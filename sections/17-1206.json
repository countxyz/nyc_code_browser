  "text": "ยง 17-1206 Waiver. Any city agency, including the department, is authorized to apply to the commissioner for a waiver of the restrictions established pursuant to section 17-1203 of this chapter. Such application shall be in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner and shall contain such information as the commissioner deems reasonable and necessary to determine whether such waiver should be granted. In determining whether to grant or deny a request for a waiver, the commissioner shall consider whether the application of 17-1203 would be, in the absence of the waiver, unreasonable with respect to (i) the magnitude of the infestation, (ii) the threat to public health, (iii) the availability of effective alternatives and (iv) the likelihood of exposure of humans to the pesticide. Such waiver may be issued with respect to one or multiple applications and may be granted for a term deemed appropriate by the commissioner, provided, however, that such term shall not exceed one year. Within thirty days of granting a waiver, the department shall provide the pest management committee with a copy of such waiver. ",
