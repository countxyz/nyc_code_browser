Any receiver, referee, trustee, assignee or other fiduciary, or any officer or agent appointed by any court, who conducts the business of any corporation, shall be subject to the tax imposed by this subchapter in the same manner and to the same extent as if the business were conducted by the agents or officers of such corporation.

(a) Corporations subject to tax under subchapter three of this chapter or under chapter eleven of this title, any trust company organized under a law of this state all of the stock of which is owned by not less than twenty savings banks organized under a law of this state, bank holding companies filing a combined return in accordance with subdivision (f) of section 11-646 of this chapter, a captive REIT or a captive RIC filing a combined return under subdivision (f) of section 11-646 of this chapter, housing companies organized and operating pursuant to the provisions of article two of the private housing finance law, housing development fund companies organized pursuant to the provisions of article eleven of the private housing finance law, corporations described in section three of the tax law, a corporation principally engaged in the operation of marine vessels whose activities in the city are limited exclusively to the use of property in interstate or foreign commerce, provided, however, such a corporation will not be subject to tax under this subchapter solely because it maintains an office in the city, or employs capital in the city, in connection with such use of property, a corporation principally engaged in the conduct of a ferry business and operating between any of the boroughs of the city under a lease granted by the city and a corporation principally engaged in the conduct of an aviation, steamboat, ferry or navigation business, or two or more of such businesses, all of the capital stock of which is owned by a municipal corporation of this state, shall not be subject to tax under this subchapter; provided, however, that any corporation, other than (1) a utility corporation subject to the supervision of the state department of public service, and (2) for taxable years beginning on or after August first, two thousand two, a utility as defined in subdivision six of section 11-1101 of this title, which is subject to tax under chapter eleven of this title as a vendor of utility services shall be subject to tax under this subchapter, but in computing the tax imposed by this section pursuant to the provisions of clause one of subparagraph (a) of paragraph A of subdivision one of section 11-604, business income allocated to the city pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision three of such section shall be reduced by the percentage which such corporation's gross operating income subject to tax under chapter eleven of this title is of its gross operating income. (b) The term \"gross operating income\", when used in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, means receipts received in or by reason of any transaction had and consummated in the city, including cash, credits and property of any kind or nature (whether or not such transaction is made for profit), without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of the property sold, the cost of materials used, labor or other services, delivery costs or any other costs whatsoever, interest or discount paid or any other expenses whatsoever. (c) If it shall appear to the commissioner of finance that the application of the proviso of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, does not fairly and equitably reflect the portion of the taxpayer's business income allocable to the city which is attributable to its city activities which are not taxable under subchapter two of chapter eleven of this title, the commissioner may prescribe other means or methods of determining such portion, including the use of the books and records of the taxpayer, if the commissioner finds that such means or methods used in keeping them fairly and equitably reflect such portion. 5. The tax imposed by subdivision one of this section, with the modifications provided by subdivision six of this section, is imposed for each calendar or fiscal year beginning with calendar or fiscal years ending in or with the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six. 6. (a) The tax for any taxable year ending prior to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six shall be an amount equal to the tax imposed by subdivision one of this section for such taxable year, multiplied by the number of months (or major portions thereof) in such taxable year which occur after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five and divided by the number of months (or major portions thereof) in such taxable year. (b) In lieu of the method of computation of tax prescribed in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, if the taxpayer maintained adequate records for the portion of any taxable year ending prior to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, which portion falls within the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six, it may elect to compute the tax for such taxable year by determining entire net income on the basis of the entire taxable income which it would have reported for federal income tax purposes had it filed a federal income tax return for a taxable year beginning January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and ending with the close of its actual taxable year and such taxable year beginning January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be deemed to be the period covered by its report, except that in computing such tax any portion of a capital loss which results from a capital loss carryover and any net operating loss deduction, as modified pursuant to paragraph (f) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter, shall be reduced by the same part of such portion of such capital loss or of such net operating loss deduction (as the case may be) as the number of months (or major portions thereof) in the taxable year occurring before January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six is of the number of months (or major portions thereof) in such taxable year. 7. For any taxable year of a real estate investment trust as defined in section eight hundred fifty-six of the internal revenue code in which such trust is subject to federal income taxation under section eight hundred fifty-seven of such code, such trust shall be subject to a tax computed under either clause one of subparagraph (a) of paragraph A of subdivision one of section 11-604 of this subchapter with respect to its entire net income, or clause four, whichever is greater, and shall not be subject to any tax under subchapter three of this chapter, except for a captive REIT required to file a combined return under subdivision (f) of section 11-646 of this chapter. In the case of such a real estate investment trust, including a captive REIT as defined in section 11-601 of this chapter, the term \"entire net income\" means \"real estate investment trust taxable income\" as defined in paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section eight hundred fifty-seven (as modified by section eight hundred fifty-eight) of the internal revenue code plus the amount taxable under paragraph three of subdivision (b) of section eight hundred fifty-seven of such code, subject to the modification required by subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter (other than the modification required by clause two of paragraph (a) and by paragraph (f) thereof) including the modifications required by paragraphs (d) and (e) of subdivision three of section 11-604 of this subchapter. 8. For any taxable year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred eighty-one of a regulated investment company, as defined in section eight hundred fifty-one of the internal revenue code, in which such company is subject to federal income taxation under section eight hundred fifty-two of such code, such company shall be subject to a tax computed under clause one or four of subparagraph (a) of paragraph E of subdivision one of section 11-604 of this subchapter, whichever is greater, and such company shall not be subject to any tax under subchapter three of this chapter, except for a captive RIC required to file a combined return under subdivision (f) of section 11-646 of this chapter. In the case of such a regulated investment company, including a captive RIC as defined in section 11-601 of this chapter, the term \"entire net income\" used in subdivision one of this section means \"investment company taxable income\" as defined in paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section eight hundred fifty-two, as modified by section eight hundred fifty-five, of the internal revenue code plus the amount taxable under paragraph three of subdivision (b) of section eight hundred fifty-two of such code subject to the modifications required by subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter, other than the modification required by clause two of paragraph (a) and by paragraph (f) thereof, including the modification required by paragraphs (d) and (e) of subdivision three of section 11-604 of this subchapter. 9.
