Upon the basis of the mortality and other tables herein authorized, and regular interest, the actuary shall compute the amount of contributions, expressed as a proportion of the compensation paid to each such member, which, if paid semi-monthly during the entire prospective city-service of the member, would be sufficient to provide for the reserve required at the time of his or her death to cover the dependent benefits which might be payable pursuant to the provisions of section 13-355 of this subchapter. Such proportion of compensation shall be computed to remain constant during his or her prospective city-service. Upon the death of such a member, an amount equal to the reserve for such dependent benefits shall be transferred from the dependent benefit contingent reserve fund to the dependent benefit reserve fund.
