The supreme court of the judicial district in which the real estate, or any part thereof, is situated, shall have power at any time to amend any defect or informality in any of the special proceedings authorized by this subchapter as may be necessary, or to cause other property to be included therein and to direct such further notice to be given to any party in interest as it deems proper, and also to appoint other commissioners in place of any who shall die, or refuse or neglect to serve, or be incapable of serving or be removed. Such court may at any time remove any of such commissioners of appraisal who, in its judgment, shall be incapable of serving or who shall for any reason in its judgment be an unfit person to serve as such commissioner. The cause of such removal shall be specified in the order making the same. If, in any particular, it shall, at any time, be found necessary to amend any pleading or proceeding, or to supply any defect therein, arising in the course of any special proceeding authorized by this subchapter, the same may be corrected or supplied in such manner as may be directed by the supreme court, which is hereby authorized to make such amendment or correction.
