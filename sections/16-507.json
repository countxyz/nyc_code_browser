Except in the case of a business issued a registration by reason of the grant of an exemption from the requirement for a license pursuant to section 16-505 of this chapter, an applicant for registration shall submit an application on a form prescribed by the commission and containing such information as the commission determines will adequately identify the business of such applicant. An applicant for registration to remove trade waste generated in the course of such applicant's business shall identify, in a manner to be prescribed by the commission, each vehicle that will transport waste pursuant to such registration. An application for registration as a trade waste broker shall contain information regarding any financial, contractual or employment relationship between such broker and a trade waste business. Any such relationship shall be indicated on the registration issued to such broker. b. A registrant shall, in accordance with rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to section 16-504 of this chapter, inform the commission of any changes in the ownership composition of the registrant, the addition or deletion of any principal at any time subsequent to the issuance of the registration, the arrest or criminal conviction of any principal of the business, or any other material change in the information submitted on the application for registration. c. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commission may, when there is reasonable cause to believe that a trade waste broker who is an applicant for registration lacks good character, honesty and integrity, require that such applicant be fingerprinted and provide to the commission the information set forth in subdivision b of section 16-508 of this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, refuse to register such applicant for the reasons set forth in paragraphs (i) through (xi) of subdivision a of section 16-509 of this chapter. (ii) If at any time subsequent to the registration of a trade waste broker or the issuance of a registration issued by reason of the grant of an exemption from the requirement for a license pursuant to section 16-505 of this chapter, the commission has reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the principals of such broker or such exempt business do not possess good character, honesty and integrity, the commission may require that such principal(s) be fingerprinted and provide the background information required by subdivision b of section 16-508 of this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, revoke the registration of such trade waste broker or such exempt business for the reasons set forth in paragraphs (i) through (x) of subdivision a of section 16-509 of this chapter.
