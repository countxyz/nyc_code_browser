The annual determination of the normal contribution for fiscal years occurring during the period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight and ending on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-eight shall appropriately take account of the nineteen hundred eighty-eight unfunded accrued liability adjustment as provided for in such section 13-638.1 and the provisions of subparagraph (b) of paragraph two of this subdivision b shall be deemed to be conformably modified for such purpose. (c) (i) Any amount required by the provisions of items (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph and subparagraph (b) of this paragraph and section 13-704 of this title to be contributed to the contingent reserve fund in the city's nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year or any subsequent fiscal year shall be payable with interest on such amount at a rate per centum per annum equal to the rate per centum per annum required to be used for the purpose of any actuarial valuation, determination or appraisal made to determine the amount of the normal contribution payable to the contingent reserve fund in such fiscal year. (ii) Any amount required to be contributed to the contingent reserve fund in any fiscal year of the city preceding the nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year shall be deemed to have been required to be paid with interest on such amount at a rate per centum per annum equal to the rate per centum per annum required to be used for the purpose of any actuarial valuation, determination or appraisal made to determine the amount of the normal contribution payable to the contingent reserve fund in such fiscal year. (iii) It is hereby declared that the provisions of items (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, insofar as they relate to provisions of this chapter or other laws requiring payment of employer contributions to the retirement system prior to the date of enactment of the act which added this subparagraph, express the intent of such provisions of this title or other laws requiring such payment. (iv) The city and all other responsible obligors (as defined in paragraph ten of subdivision a of section 13-638.2 of this title) shall make all payments to the retirement system required by applicable law in accordance with the time of payment requirements set forth in subdivision c of section 13-133 of this chapter. Any responsible obligor which does not make all or any portion of such required payments to the retirement system in a timely manner in fiscal year two thousand twelve--two thousand thirteen, or in any fiscal year thereafter, shall be required to pay interest to the retirement system on such overdue amounts, as determined by the actuary. The actuary shall determine, at such time as he or she deems appropriate, interest payments on such overdue amounts using a rate of interest equivalent to the valuation rate of interest (as defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a of section 13-638.2 of this title). Responsible obligors shall make such interest payments on overdue amounts to the retirement system in the manner and at such time as the actuary deems appropriate. (d) The requirements of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph with respect to contributions to the contingent reserve fund and the requirements, if any, of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph with respect to contributions to such fund, and the requirements of subparagraph (c) of this paragraph with respect to payment of interest on contributions to such fund shall be subject to the provisions of sections 13-130, 13-131 and 13-132 of this chapter. (2) Normal contribution. (a) (i) Notwithstanding the succeeding provisions of this subparagraph or the provisions of subparagraph (a-one), (b) or (c) of this paragraph, for fiscal year two thousand eleven--two thousand twelve, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the amount of the normal contribution payable to the contingent reserve fund shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (d) of this paragraph. Upon the basis of the latest mortality and other tables herein authorized and regular interest, the actuary shall determine as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, the amount of the total liability for all benefits provided in this title, in articles eleven and fourteen of the retirement and social security law and in any other law prescribing benefits payable by the retirement system on account of all members and beneficiaries, excluding the liability on account of future increased-take-home-pay contributions, if any, and the liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund, provided, however, that in determining such total liability as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-five and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, the actuary shall include (A) the liability on account of future increased-take-home-pay contributions, if any, (B) the liability on account of future public employer obligations under the provisions of subdivision twenty of section two hundred forty-three of the military law, to pay in behalf of members qualifying for such benefit, member contributions with respect to certain periods of the military service of such members and (C) the liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund. (ii) For the purposes of subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph, the actuary shall determine, as of June thirtieth, two thousand and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, the total liability of the retirement system which shall be an amount equal to the sum of (A) the total liability for all benefits as determined pursuant to item (i) of this subparagraph, (B) the amount, as estimated by the actuary, of the total liability of the retirement system on account of all payments which the retirement system may be required to make for base fiscal years beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine to the correction officers' variable supplements fund and the correction captains' and above variable supplements fund, and (C) the amount, if any, as estimated by the actuary, of the total liability of the retirement system on account of payments which the retirement system may be required to make to any other fund without a corresponding offset in the liabilities of the retirement system. (a-1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, for the purpose of calculating the amount of the normal contribution due from the city to the contingent reserve fund pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this paragraph in fiscal year two thousand five--two thousand six, and in each fiscal year thereafter, both the total liability of the retirement system, as calculated by the actuary in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and the normal rate of contributions, as calculated by the actuary in accordance with subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall be determined as of June thirtieth of the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, provided, however, that (i) the actuary shall use for such calculations the mortality and other tables that are applicable at the time he or she performs such calculations; (ii) the total funds on hand, as determined by the actuary pursuant to sub-item (E) of item (i) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall be adjusted by adding to such amount the present value of all employer contributions required to be paid into the contingent reserve fund in the fiscal year next preceding the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, as determined by the actuary; and (iii) the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members, as computed by the actuary for the purposes of item (ii) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall be reduced by the present value of the salaries expected to be paid to all members in the fiscal year next preceding the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, as determined by the actuary. (b) The normal rate of contribution shall be the rate per centum obtained: (i) by deducting from the amount of such total liability the sum of: (A) (1) the amount obtained by adding together the present value of all required future revised unfunded accrued liability contributions and the present value of all required future payments of the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment, determined pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of this subdivision, if such adjustment is a charge; or (2) the remainder obtained by subtracting from the present value of all required future revised unfunded accrued liability contributions, the present value of all future installments of the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment required to be credited, if such nineteen hundred eighty adjustment is a credit; (3) minus (whether (1) or (2) of this sub-item (A) is applicable) the present value of all future installments of the nineteen hundred eighty-two unfunded accrued liability adjustment; and (A-1) the present value of all future installments of the aggregate nineteen hundred eighty-five unfunded accrued liability adjustment determined pursuant to sub-item (K) of item (vii) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of this subdivision b; and (B) the present value of all required future balance sheet liability contributions, plus, in the case of the determination of the normal contributions payable in fiscal year nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one, the present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, of the payment of interest on the balance sheet liability as required by item (v) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph one of this subdivision; and (C) the present value of all required future payments, pursuant to section 13-704 of this title, of installments of losses in excess of installments of gains on dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and (D) in the case of the determination of the normal contribution payable in each fiscal year commencing with fiscal year nineteen hundred ninety-five--nineteen hundred ninety-six, the present value of future member contributions of all members; and (E) the total funds on hand, including the amount of any unpaid moneys appropriated pursuant to section 13-133 of this chapter and, in the case of the determination of the normal contribution payable in each fiscal year commencing with fiscal year nineteen hundred ninety-five--nineteen hundred ninety-six, including the amount in the annuity savings fund; and (F) the present value of all other future installments of accrued liability contributions to the retirement system required by the applicable provisions of section 13-638.2 of this title which are not covered by the preceding subitems of this item (i); and (ii) by dividing the remainder by one per centum of the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members, as computed by the actuary on the basis of the latest mortality and service tables adopted pursuant to section 13-121 of this subchapter, and on the basis of regular interest. The normal rate of contribution determined by the actuary shall not be less than zero, shall be certified by the actuary after each such valuation and shall continue in force until the next succeeding valuation and certification. (c) (i) The amount of the normal contribution due from the city to the contingent reserve fund in each city fiscal year, commencing with the nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year and ending with the two thousand four--two thousand five fiscal year, shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the normal rate of contribution, as determined by the actuary as of June thirtieth next preceding such fiscal year, by the aggregate annual salaries of the members on such next preceding June thirtieth, and shall be payable in such fiscal year next following such June thirtieth, together with such regular interest thereon which may be due, if any, as calculated by the actuary. (ii) The amount of the normal contribution due from the city to the contingent reserve fund in each city fiscal year, commencing with the two thousand five--two thousand six fiscal year, shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the normal rate of contribution, as determined by the actuary as of the second June thirtieth preceding the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (a-1) and (b) of this paragraph, by the aggregate amount of the salaries expected to be paid to the members during the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, as determined by the actuary, and such normal contribution shall be payable in the second fiscal year following the June thirtieth as of which the normal rate of contribution is determined, together with such regular interest thereon which may be due, if any, as calculated by the actuary. (iii) In the case of the normal contribution payable in the nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year and in any subsequent fiscal year, the term \"regular interest\", as used in this subparagraph, shall mean regular interest as defined by the applicable provisions of subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of subdivision twelve of section 13-101 of this chapter. (d) (i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs of this paragraph or any other provision of law to the contrary, the normal contribution payable to the contingent reserve fund in fiscal year two thousand eleven--two thousand twelve, and in each fiscal year thereafter, shall be the entry age normal contribution, as determined by the actuary pursuant to this subparagraph in a manner consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method. The actuary shall determine the entry age normal contribution for each such fiscal year as of June thirtieth of the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such normal contribution is payable, based on the latest mortality and other tables applicable at the time he or she performs such calculations, and the valuation rate of interest as provided for the retirement system in paragraph two of subdivision b of section 13-638.2 of this title. (ii) In calculating the entry age normal contribution payable in any such fiscal year pursuant to this subparagraph, the actuary, in his or her discretion, may make certain adjustments in the calculation methodology, provided that such adjustments are generally accepted as consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method, and are designed, in general, to fund, on a level basis over the working lifetimes of members from their ages at entry, the actuarial present value of benefits to which such members are expected to become entitled, as determined by the actuary. Such generally accepted adjustments in the calculation methodology, in the discretion of the actuary, may include, but are not limited to, the calculation of the entry age normal contribution (A) on an individual member basis by calculating the amount of the entry age normal contribution attributable to each individual member, and then adding together such individual member amounts, (B) on an aggregate basis for all members or (C) on any combination of an individual member basis and an aggregate basis which is consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method, and the preceding provisions of this item. (iii) For each such fiscal year, the actuary, in his or her discretion, shall determine, in accordance with the provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph, the methodology for calculating the entry age normal contribution payable for that particular fiscal year. (iv) The methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item (iii) of this subparagraph may provide for the actuary to calculate the entry age normal contribution on an individual member basis by (A) multiplying the entry age normal contribution rate for each individual member, as determined by the actuary, by the salary expected to be paid to that member during the fiscal year in which such normal contribution is payable, and (B) calculating the sum of the individual entry age normal contributions attributable to all such members. The actuary, in his or her discretion, may make any adjustments to such methodology for determining the entry age normal contribution on an individual basis which he or she deems appropriate, and which are consistent with the provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph. (v) In the alternative, the methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item (iii) of this subparagraph may provide for the actuary to calculate the entry age normal contribution on an aggregate basis by multiplying the entry age normal contribution rate for all members in the aggregate, as determined by the actuary, by the aggregate amount of the salaries expected to be paid to all members during the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable. The actuary, in his or her discretion, may make any adjustments to such methodology for determining the entry age normal contribution on an aggregate basis which he or she deems appropriate, and which are consistent with the provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph. (vi) In the alternative, the methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item (iii) of this subparagraph may provide for the calculation of the entry age normal contribution on any other basis which the actuary deems appropriate, and which is consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method and the provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph. (vii) (A) Where the methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item (iii) of this subparagraph requires the determination of an entry age normal contribution rate for each individual member in order to calculate the entry age normal contribution for each individual member, the actuary shall determine such rate for each such member in accordance with the entry age actuarial cost method, and such rate, as determined by the actuary for each such member, shall be consistent with a method designed, in general, to fund, on a level basis over the working lifetime of that particular member from his or her age at entry, the actuarial present value of benefits to which such member is expected to become entitled, as determined by the actuary. (B) Where the methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item (iii) of this subparagraph requires the determination of an entry age normal contribution rate for all members in the aggregate in order to calculate the entry age normal contribution for all members in the aggregate, the actuary shall determine such rate in accordance with the entry age actuarial cost method, and such rate, as determined by the actuary, shall be consistent with a method designed, in general, to fund, on a level basis over the working lifetimes of members from their ages at entry, the actuarial present value of benefits to which such members are expected to become entitled, as determined by the actuary. (3) Unfunded accrued liability contributions. (a) The original unfunded accrued liability contribution shall be an amount which, if paid to the contingent reserve fund in forty equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a first installment in the city's nineteen hundred seventy-seven--nineteen hundred seventy-eight fiscal year, would be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of five and one-half per centum interest and the actuarial tables in effect as of July first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, of the difference between the accrued liability excluding the liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-five and the total funds on hand, excluding the amount in the annuity savings fund, but including the amount of any unpaid moneys appropriated pursuant to section 13-133 of this chapter. The original unfunded accrued liability contributions shall include the payments required by section 13-130 of this chapter. (b) (i) The revised unfunded accrued liability contribution shall be an amount determined as prescribed in items (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of this subparagraph (b). (ii) To the amount of the difference constituting the unfunded accrued liability as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-five heretofore determined pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph as in effect on July first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, there shall be added interest thereon at the rate of five and one-half per centum per annum for the period from July first, nineteen hundred seventy-five to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty. (iii) (A) There shall be computed, in the manner provided in sub-item (B) of this item, the discounted value of each of the installments of the unfunded accrued liability contribution which, in the absence of the enactment of chapter nine hundred fifty-seven of the laws of nineteen hundred eighty-one, were payable or would have been payable in the city's nineteen hundred seventy-seven--nineteen hundred seventy-eight, nineteen hundred seventy-eight--nineteen hundred seventy-nine, nineteen hundred seventy-nine--nineteen hundred eighty, nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one and nineteen hundred eighty-one--nineteen hundred eighty-two fiscal years. (B) Such discounted value of each such installment shall be computed as of January first of the city's second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such installment was payable or would have been payable and on the basis of five and one-half per centum interest per annum on the amount of such installment. (C) There shall be computed with respect to such discounted value of each such installment, interest thereon from January first of such second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such installment was or would have been payable to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty at the rate of five and one-half per centum per annum. (D) The discounted values of all of such installments with respect to such fiscal years, computed as provided for in sub-items (A) and (B) of this item, together with interest on each installment as provided for in sub-item (C) of this item, shall be added together. (iv) From the sum computed pursuant to item (ii) of this subparagraph, the sum computed pursuant to item (iii) of this subparagraph shall be subtracted. (v) With respect to each city fiscal year occurring during the period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty and ending on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two, the revised unfunded accrued liability contribution shall be the annual installment, applicable to such fiscal year, of an amount which, if paid to the contingent reserve fund in thirty-five equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a first installment in the city's nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year, would be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of seven and one-half per centum interest per annum, of the remainder computed pursuant to item (iv) of this subparagraph. (vi) With respect to each city fiscal year occurring during the period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two and ending on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-eight, the revised unfunded accrued liability contribution shall be the annual installment, applicable to such fiscal year, of an amount which, if paid to the contingent reserve fund in thirty-three equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a first installment in the city's nineteen hundred eighty-two--nineteen hundred eighty-three fiscal year, would be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of eight per centum interest per annum, of the present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two on the basis of seven and one-half per centum interest per annum, of the installments of the unfunded accrued liability contribution computed pursuant to item (v) of this subparagraph, which installments are hypothetically allocated by such item (v) to designated city fiscal years succeeding June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two. (vii) With respect to each city fiscal year occurring during the period beginning on July first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight and ending on June thirtieth, two thousand fifteen, the revised unfunded accrued liability contribution shall be the annual installment, applicable to such fiscal year, of an amount which, when paid to the contingent reserve fund in twenty-seven equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a first installment in the city's nineteen hundred eighty-eight--nineteen hundred eighty-nine fiscal year, shall be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of eight and one-quarter per centum interest per annum, of the present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-eight on the basis of eight per centum interest per annum, of the installments of the unfunded accrued liability contribution computed pursuant to item (vi) of this subparagraph, which installments are hypothetically allocated by such item (vi) to designated city fiscal years succeeding June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-eight. (c) (i) The nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be an amount determined as prescribed in items (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of this subparagraph. (ii) (A) Upon the basis of the actuarial tables in effect as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty for valuation purposes and interest at the rate of seven and one-half per centum per annum, there shall be determined, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, the amount of the total liability for all benefits provided in this chapter, in articles eleven and fourteen of the retirement and social security law and in any other law prescribing benefits payable by the retirement system on account of all members and beneficiaries, excluding the liability on account of future increased-take-home-pay contributions, if any, and the liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund. (B) From such total liability computed pursuant to sub-item (A) of this item, there shall be subtracted the sum of: (1) the present value, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty, of all future normal costs of the retirement system, computed pursuant to the entry age normal cost method of determining such normal costs; and (2) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all future installments of the balance sheet liability contribution (as defined in paragraph four of this subdivision b); and (3) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of all then required future payments, pursuant to section 13-704 of this title, of installments of losses in excess of installments of gains on dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and (4) the present value, as of such June thirtieth, of future member contributions of members subject to article fourteen of the retirement and social security law; and (5) the total funds on hand as of such June thirtieth, excluding the amount in the annuity savings fund, but including the amount of any unpaid moneys appropriated pursuant to section 13-133 of this chapter. (iii) (A) If the amount computed pursuant to sub-item (B) of item (ii) of this subparagraph is larger than the amount computed pursuant to item (iv) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, the latter amount shall be subtracted from the former amount and the remainder resulting from such subtraction shall constitute a charge. (B) If the amount computed pursuant to sub-item (B) of item (ii) of this subparagraph is smaller than the amount computed pursuant to item (iv) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, the former amount shall be subtracted from the latter amount and the remainder resulting from such subtraction shall constitute a credit. (iv) (A) If the remainder computed pursuant to item (iii) of this subparagraph is a charge, the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be an amount which, if paid to the contingent reserve fund in thirty equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a first installment in the city's nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year, would be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of seven and one-half per centum interest per annum, of such remainder. (B) If the remainder computed pursuant to item (iii) of this subparagraph is a credit, the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be an amount which, if credited in thirty equal annual installments (the first of which installments is to be credited in the city's nineteen hundred eighty--nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year) in reduction of the amounts which the city (and other obligors required to pay public employer contributions on account of members) would otherwise be required to pay to the contingent reserve fund pursuant to items (i), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph one of this subdivision or otherwise pursuant to law, would be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of seven and one-half per centum interest per annum, of such remainder.
