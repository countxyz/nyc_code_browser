The commissioner of finance may issue a warrant directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance commanding him or her to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person from whom the tax is due for the payment of the amount thereof, with penalties, and the cost of executing the warrants, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but he or she shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due hereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and the execution thereon had been returned not satisfied. A copy of any warrant issued may be filed with the county clerk in any of the counties of the city of New York and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax and penalty for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in the real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. b. As an additional or alternate remedy the commissioner of finance may request the corporation counsel to bring an action in the name of the city to enforce payment of a tax or penalty which any person has failed to pay. c. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision a of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant. ",
