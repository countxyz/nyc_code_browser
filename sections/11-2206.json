Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the tax. Such a determination by the commissioner of motor vehicles shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination, shall apply to the commissioner of motor vehicles for a hearing, or unless such commissioner of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same.
