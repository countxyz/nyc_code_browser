It shall not be necessary for the city to plead or prove the various steps, procedures and notices for the assessment and levy of the taxes, assessments or other lawful charges against the parcels set forth in the list of delinquent taxes and all such taxes, assessments or other lawful charges and the lien thereof shall be presumed to be valid. A defendant alleging any jurisdictional defect or invalidity in such taxes, assessments or other lawful charges or in the foreclosure thereof must particularly specify in his or her answer such jurisdictional defect or invalidity and must affirmatively establish such defense. A judgment of foreclosure granted in any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter, which contains recitals that any acts were done or proceedings had which were necessary to give the court jurisdiction or power to grant such judgment of foreclosure, shall be presumptive evidence that such acts were duly performed or proceedings duly had, if such judgment of foreclosure shall have been duly entered or filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the proceeding was pending and wherein such judgment was granted. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to and be valid and effective with respect to all defendants even though one or more of them be infants, incompetents, absentees or non-residents of the state of New York.
