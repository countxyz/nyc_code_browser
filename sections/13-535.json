Such board shall annually allow regular interest on each of the funds provided for in this chapter with the exception of the expense fund and pension reserve fund number two. The amount so allowed shall be due and payable to such funds and shall be annually credited thereto by such board. b. The investment earnings of the retirement system shall be determined for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four. To the extent that such earnings are in excess of the amount allowed as regular interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four, the board shall declare a rate of special interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the amount required for the allowance of regular interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four in the annuity savings funds of members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four. Special interest, as determined by multiplying said special interest rate by the mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four in the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four, shall be credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-four to the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are members, with a balance, after adjustment, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five and who are allowed regular interest at the rate of three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four. For members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four and who do not have a balance, after adjustment, in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five, a payment shall be made equal to the amount of special interest which would have been credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-four had they had a balance in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five, provided that the sum of said special interest and any additional interest to be paid pursuant to paragraph c hereof is ten dollars or more. Special interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members. c. If the full one per centum of special interest has been allowed, then to the extent that the amount of said earnings exceeds the amount allowed as regular interest and the amount allowed or paid as special interest, the board shall declare a rate of additional interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of regular interest and the allowance and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four which would be the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of all members to whom special interest is credited or paid pursuant to paragraph b hereof. In determining the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of any member to whom special interest is credited pursuant to paragraph b hereof additional interest, as determined by multiplying said additional interest rate by the mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four which would be said member's reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be included. However, for members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four and who retire or die prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five, the amount of additional interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four shall not be included in the retirement allowance, but shall be paid in a single payment provided that the sum of said additional interest and any special interest to be paid pursuant to paragraph b hereof is ten dollars or more. Additional interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members. d. The investment earnings of the retirement system shall be determined for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five. To the extent that such earnings are in excess of the amount allowed as regular interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five, the board shall declare a rate of special interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the amount required for the allowance of regular interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five in the annuity savings funds of members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five. Special interest, as determined by multiplying said special interest rate by the mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five in the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five, shall be credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five to the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are members, with a balance, after adjustment, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six and who are allowed regular interest at the rate of three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five. For members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five and who do not have a balance, after adjustment, in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, a payment shall be made equal to the amount of special interest which would have been credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five had they had a balance in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, provided that the sum of said special interest and any additional interest to be paid pursuant to paragraph e hereof is ten dollars or more. Special interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members. e. If the full one per centum of special interest has been allowed, then to the extent that the amount of said earnings exceeds the amount allowed as regular interest and the amount allowed or paid as special interest, the board shall declare a rate of additional interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of regular interest and the allowance and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five which would be the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of all members to whom special interest is credited or paid pursuant to paragraph d hereof. In determining the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of any member to whom special interest is credited pursuant to paragraph d hereof, additional interest as determined by multiplying said additional interest rate by the mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five which would be said member's reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be included. However, for members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five and who retire or die prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, the amount of additional interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five shall not be included in the retirement allowance, but shall be paid in a single payment provided that the sum of said additional interest and any special interest to be paid pursuant to paragraph d hereof is ten dollars or more. Additional interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members. f. The investment earnings of the retirement system shall be determined for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six. To the extent that such earnings are in excess of the amount allowed as regular interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six, the board shall declare a rate of special interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the amount required for the allowance of regular interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six in the annuity savings funds of members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six. Special interest, as determined by multiplying said special interest rate by the mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six in the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six to the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are members, with a balance, after adjustment, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven and who are allowed regular interest at the rate of three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six. For members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six and who do not have a balance, after adjustment, in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, a payment shall be made equal to the amount of special interest which would have been credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six had they had a balance in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, provided that the sum of said special interest and any additional interest to be paid pursuant to paragraph g hereof is ten dollars or more. Special interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members. g. If the full one per centum of special interest has been allowed, then to the extent that the amount of said earnings exceeds the amount allowed as regular interest and the amount allowed or paid as special interest, the board shall declare a rate of additional interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of regular interest and the allowance and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six which would be the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of all members to whom special interest is credited or paid pursuant to paragraph f hereof. In determining the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of any member to whom special interest is credited pursuant to paragraph f hereof, additional interest as determined by multiplying said additional interest rate by the mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six which would be said member's reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be included. However, for members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six and who retire or die prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, the amount of additional interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six shall not be included in the retirement allowance, but shall be paid in a single payment provided that the sum of said additional interest and any special interest to be paid pursuant to paragraph f hereof is ten dollars or more.
