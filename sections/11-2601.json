(1) For the purpose of determining whether a mortgage is subject to the tax imposed by subdivision b or c of this section at a rate in excess of fifty cents, or by subdivision d of this section at a rate in excess of one dollar, for each one hundred dollars and each remaining major fraction thereof of principal debt or obligation, the principal debt or obligation which is or under any contingency may be secured at the date of execution thereof, or at any time thereafter, by such mortgage shall be aggregated with the principal debt or obligation which is or under any contingency may be secured at the date of execution thereof, or at any time thereafter, by any other mortgage, where such mortgages form part of the same or related transactions and have the same or related mortgagors. If the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that a mortgage transaction or mortgage transactions have been formulated for the purpose of avoiding or evading a rate of tax imposed under this section in excess of the lowest such rate, rather than solely for an independent business or financial purpose, such commissioner shall treat all of the mortgages forming part of such transaction or transactions as a single mortgage for the purpose of determining the applicable rate of tax. For the purposes of this subdivision, all mortgages having the same or related mortgagors offered for recording within a period of twelve consecutive months shall be presumed to form part of a related transaction, unless clear and convincing evidence is offered to the contrary. The commissioner of taxation and finance may require such affidavits and forms, and may prescribe such rules and regulations, as he determines to be necessary to enforce the provisions of this subdivision. (2) The term \"related\", when used in this subdivision with reference to mortgagors, shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following relationships: (i) members of a family, including spouses, ancestors, lineal descendants, and brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half blood); (ii) a shareholder and a corporation more than fifty percent of the value of the outstanding stock of which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such shareholder; (iii) a partner and a partnership more than fifty percent of the capital or profits interest in which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such partner; (iv) a beneficiary and a trust more than fifty percent of the beneficial interest in which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such beneficiary; (v) two or more corporations, partnerships, associations, or trusts, or any combination thereof, which are owned or controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the same person, corporation or other entity, or interests; and (vi) a grantor of a trust and such trust. f. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section two hundred fifty-five of the tax law, the taxes imposed by subdivision c or d of this section shall also apply to principal indebtedness or obligation secured by or which under any contingency may be secured by a supplemental instrument or additional mortgage, whether or not there is any new or further indebtedness or obligation other than the principal indebtedness or obligation secured by a recorded primary mortgage, where (1) the supplemental instrument or additional mortgage imposes the lien of a recorded mortgage upon real property situated within the city not previously subject to the mortgage or where an additional mortgage upon such additional property is recorded as additional or substitute security for indebtedness or obligation already secured by a recorded mortgage and (2) the recorded primary mortgage was on real property outside the city and recorded without payment of the city tax.
