Any withdrawn contributor, who does not withdraw his or her contributions from the annuity savings fund, on again entering the membership as the result of reappointment or restoration to service, may be entitled to the service credit and status, including the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay, to which he or she was entitled immediately prior to his or her withdrawal, except as provided in section 13-556 of this chapter, provided that he or she returns to membership within a period of seven school years following such withdrawal, and further provided, that he or she has not been absent from service for more than seven school years during any ten consecutive school years since he or she became a contributor of the retirement system, and further provided that in computing his or her average salary for retirement purposes only the earnable salary for years of actual service shall be used.
