The council hereby finds that it is in the public interest to hold certain elections on days other than those which the vast majority of the people of the city respect as a day of worship and a day of rest. The holding of elections on such days of worship is unfair to those citizens who observe such days of worship in that they are unable to participate fully in the election process on an equal basis unless they violate their religious precepts. This poses a threat to the free exercise of religion and equality of access to the electoral process. The council further finds and declares that bigotry, prejudice and intolerance will be discouraged if such elections are forbidden on those days of worship, and that holding elections on other days will permit the participation of a greater number of people.
