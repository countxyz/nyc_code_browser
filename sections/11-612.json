If the amount of tax as so adjusted shall be less than the amount theretofore paid, the excess shall be refunded by the commissioner of finance as provided in subdivision one of section 11-677 of this chapter. 6. Every such trust company and savings bank, which shall be dissolved, and shall not become merged or consolidated with another corporation taxable under this part, shall, if dissolution takes place between the thirtieth day of June and the succeeding first day of January, be subject to a tax, for that part of such period in which it had been doing business, computed in the same manner and at the same rate as the minimum tax under subdivision two of this section, except that the income forming the basis for proration shall be the income for the calendar year in which such dissolution occurs; and the issued capital stock, or interest credited to depositors of a savings bank, shall be taken as of the date of dissolution; provided, however, that the tax so computed shall be reduced one-half and an additional one-twelfth for each month, or major portion thereof, between the date of dissolution and the succeeding first day of January. If dissolution occurs between the thirty-first day of December and the succeeding sixteenth day of March, such trust company and savings bank shall be subject to the same tax that would have been due from it on or before the fifteenth day of March had it not been dissolved, except that such tax shall be reduced one-twelfth for each month, or major portion thereof, from the date of dissolution to the succeeding first day of July, and shall be for the period beginning on the preceding first day of July and ending on the date of dissolution. In no event shall the tax under this subdivision be less than ten dollars except that for the year nineteen hundred seventy-one and those following, in no event shall the tax under this subdivision be less than twelve and one-half dollars. 7. In the case of a consolidation or merger of taxpayers, or in case a national bank taxable under part two of this subchapter shall be consolidated or merged with a taxpayer under this part, or in case of a series of such transactions, there shall be added to the net income of the taxpayer resulting from such consolidations or mergers the net income of the taxpayers which are consolidated or merged for the period for which the taxpayer resulting from such consolidation or merger is required to render any return under this part, and if such resulting taxpayer is a savings bank or savings and loan association, there shall be added to the interest or dividends credited by it to depositors or shareholders the amount of interest or dividends credited to depositors or shareholders during such period by the taxpayers which are consolidated or merged, except that net income, interest or dividends shall not be included if they have already been used as the basis for a tax under this part, and the tax payable on filing such return shall be based upon the entire net income reported therein or upon the entire amount of interest or dividends so reported, as the case may be. The acquisition by a taxpayer, directly or indirectly, of the assets or franchises of another taxpayer or national bank shall be deemed a merger for the purposes of this section. 8. The tax imposed by this part shall be for the calendar year next preceding the year in which it becomes due; except that with respect to corporations subject to a tax imposed under subdivision three, four, five or six of this section, the tax shall be for the period therein specified, and except that with respect to corporations required to file a declaration of estimated tax and to make payments on account of such estimated tax as provided by section 11-636 of this subchapter, all payments of tax within a calendar year, whether computed on the basis of net income for the current calendar year or on the basis of net income for the preceding calendar year, shall be for the calendar year in which the payments are required to be made. 9. In the event that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the taxes imposed on national banking associations by part two of this subchapter are unconstitutional or invalid for the reason that they are not in conformity with the provisions of section fifty-two hundred nineteen of the United States revised statutes, then, in lieu of the taxes imposed by the provisions of this part, every corporation that otherwise would have been subject to tax under this part shall be subject to the tax imposed under subchapter two as of July thirteenth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and all of the provisions of subchapter two, unless clearly inappropriate, shall be applicable except subdivision four of section 11-603 of this chapter; and, in such event, any payments made, reports or returns filed or any act of the commissioner of finance or of a taxpayer purportedly under this subchapter shall be treated as though made, filed or done pursuant to subchapter two. 10.
