Subject to the provisions of subdivision b of this section, any person who violates this chapter, except subdivision f of section 16-308 of this chapter or 16-310.1 of this chapter, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, shall be liable for a civil penalty recoverable in a civil action brought in the name of the commissioner or in a proceeding returnable before the environmental control board, as follows: 1. For residential buildings containing fewer than nine dwelling units, the civil penalty shall be in an amount of twenty-five dollars for the first violation, fifty dollars for the second violation committed on a different day within a period of twelve months, and one hundred dollars for the third and each subsequent violation committed on a different day within a period of twelve months, provided that the court before which such civil action is brought or such board may waive the penalty for the first violation upon a showing of good cause. 2. For residential buildings containing nine or more dwelling units and commercial, manufacturing or industrial buildings, the civil penalty shall be in an amount of one hundred dollars for the first violation, two hundred dollars for the second violation committed on a different day within a period of twelve months, and four hundred dollars for the third and each subsequent violation committed on a different day within a period of twelve months, provided that the court before which such civil action is brought or such board may waive the penalty for the first violation upon a showing of good cause. The owner, net lessee or person in charge of any residential building of nine or more dwelling units or a commercial, manufacturing or industrial building with respect to which four or more violations were committed on different days within a period of six months shall be classified as a persistent violator. 3. For persistent violators only, each container or bag containing solid waste that has not been source separated or placed out for collection in accordance with the rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter shall constitute a separate violation, provided that no more than twenty separate violations are issued on a per bag or per container basis during any twenty-four hour period. Before issuing any such notices of violation to a persistent violator on a per bag or per container basis, the commissioner shall give such violator a reasonable opportunity to correct the condition constituting the violation. 4. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the number of dwelling units designated on a notice of violation issued pursuant to this section reflects the number of dwelling units in the residential building for which the notice of violation was issued. Where such presumption is rebutted, the number of dwelling units on such notice of violation shall be deemed modified accordingly, and in no event shall such notice of violation be dismissed solely on the ground that the number of dwelling units on the original notice of violation was incorrectly stated. 5. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall establish a recycling training program for owners or employees of residential buildings of nine or more dwelling units for which at least three notices of violation for failing to properly source separate designated recyclable material have been issued within a twelve-month period and which the commissioner determines to be in need of recycling training. Such training program shall require the building owner, or an employee who is primarily responsible for waste disposal and/or janitorial services for any such building, to attend a training program established by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee designed to improve recycling practices at such building and a fee may be imposed on any owner or employee who participates in such training program. Such training program may be held in any location designated by the commissioner or the commissioner's designee, including, in order to facilitate tenant participation, at such building. b. Any person who violates subdivision f of section 16-308 of this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars for the first violation, one thousand dollars for the second violation committed within a twelve-month period, and two thousand five hundred dollars for the third and each subsequent violation committed within a twelve-month period. c. Any owner or other person responsible for a publicly accessible textile drop-off bin who violates subdivision b of section 16-310.1 of this chapter shall be liable as follows: 1. In the event that a publicly accessible textile drop-off bin is impermissibly placed on city property, or property maintained by the city, or on any public sidewalk or roadway, the owner of the publicly accessible textile drop-off bin, if the address of such owner is ascertainable, shall be notified by the department by certified mail, return receipt requested, that such publicly accessible textile drop-off bin must be removed within thirty days from the mailing of such notice. A copy of such notice, regardless of whether the address of such owner or other responsible person is ascertainable, shall also be affixed to the publicly accessible textile drop-off bin. This notice shall state that if the address of the owner or other responsible person is not ascertainable and notice is not mailed by the department, such publicly accessible textile drop-off bin shall be removed within thirty days from the affixing of such notice. This notice shall also state that the failure to remove the publicly accessible textile drop-off bin within the designated time period will result in the removal and disposal of the publicly accessible textile drop-off bin by the department. This notice shall also state that if the owner or other responsible person objects to removal on the grounds that the publicly accessible textile drop-off bin is not on city property, or property maintained by the city, or on any public sidewalk or roadway, such owner or other responsible person may send written objection to the department at the address indicated on the notice within twenty days from the mailing of such notice or, if the address of such owner or other responsible person is not ascertainable and notice is not mailed by the department, within twenty days from the affixing of such notice, with proof that the publicly accessible textile drop-off bin is not on city property, or property maintained by the city, or on any public sidewalk or roadway. Proof that the publicly accessible textile drop-off bin is not on city property, or property maintained by the city, or on any public sidewalk or roadway shall include, but not be limited to, a survey of the property prepared by a licensed surveyor that is certified by the record owner of such property. 2. Any owner or other person responsible for an impermissibly placed publicly accessible textile drop-off bin that fails to respond within twenty days of receipt of such notice under paragraph one of this subdivision or otherwise fails to establish that the publicly accessible textile drop-off bin is not on city property, or property maintained by the city, or on any public sidewalk or roadway pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, shall be liable for a civil penalty in the amount of one hundred dollars, recoverable in a proceeding returnable before the environmental control board. d. Any notice of violation or notice of hearing for a violation issued to the owner, net lessee or person in charge of a premises at which a violation of this chapter or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto is alleged to have occurred shall be served by delivering a copy of the notice thereof at the address maintained in the records of the department of housing preservation and development or the department of finance. The notice of violation or notice of hearing may be served by regular mail or in accordance with section one thousand forty-nine-a of the charter. ",
