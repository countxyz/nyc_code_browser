In addition to any other enforcement procedures authorized by law, the commissioner, with the written approval of the commissioner of health and mental hygiene, shall be authorized to order in writing that premises on which activity in violation of this section is occurring be closed if the commissioner finds that continuing activity on such premises would result in generation, storage or disposal of regulated medical waste or other medical waste in a manner posing an imminent threat to the public health or safety, provided that no facility licensed, permitted or certificated pursuant to article twenty-eight of the public health law or part thereof or facility providing inpatient services or part thereof may be closed pursuant to this subdivision. Such premises may be opened at any time by any person otherwise lawfully entitled to enter such premises in response to an immediate threat to the health or safety of one or more individuals, or of the public.
