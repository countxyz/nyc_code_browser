The council declares that due to the irreversible nature of the sterilization procedure, it is essential that the patient fully comprehends the effects and possible complications of the operation. The patient should have a reasonable time to consider his or her decision and possible alternative methods of contraception before the operation is performed. Since it is within the purview of the public policy of the city to preserve, protect and improve the public health, safety and welfare, it is imperative that the council establish standards governing the performance of sterilizations.
