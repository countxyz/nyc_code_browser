(a) All surcharge monies remitted to the commissioner of finance by a service supplier and all other monies dedicated to the payment of system costs from whatever source derived or received by the city of New York shall be expended only upon authorization of the council, and only for payment of system costs as permitted by this chapter. The finance commissioner and the director of the office of management and budget shall separately account for and keep adequate records of the amount and source of all such revenues and of the amount and object or purpose of all expenditures thereof. (b) If at the end of any fiscal year the total amount of all such revenues exceeds the amount necessary for payment of system costs in such fiscal year, such excess shall be reserved and carried over for the payment of system costs in the following fiscal year in conformance with applicable law. However, if at the end of any fiscal year such E911 reserved fund balance exceeds an amount equal to five per cent of that necessary for the payment of system costs in such fiscal year, the council shall by local law reduce the surcharge for the following fiscal year to a level that more adequately reflects the system cost requirements of its E911 system. The council may also reestablish or increase such surcharge, subject to the provisions of section three hundred three of the county law, if the revenues generated by such surcharge and by any other source are not adequate to pay for system costs.
