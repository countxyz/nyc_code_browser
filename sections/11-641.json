(3) Applicable expenses shall be any expenses or other deductions attributable, directly or indirectly, to the eligible gross income described in paragraph two of this subdivision. (4) Adjusted eligible net income shall be determined by subtracting from eligible net income the ineligible funding amount, and by subtracting from the amount then remaining the floor amount. (5) The ineligible funding amount shall be the amount, if any, determined by multiplying eligible net income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average aggregate amount for the taxable year of all liabilities, including deposits, and other sources of funds of the international banking facility which were not owed to or received from foreign persons, and the denominator of which is the average aggregate amount for the taxable year of all liabilities, including deposits and other sources of funds of the international banking facility.

(C) The percentage shall be one hundred percent for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer establishes an international banking facility and for the next succeeding four taxable years. The percentage shall be eighty percent for the fifth, sixty percent for the sixth, forty percent for the seventh, and twenty percent for the eighth taxable year next succeeding the year such taxpayer establishes such international banking facility, and zero in the ninth succeeding year and thereafter. (7) In the event adjusted eligible net income is a loss, such loss shall be added to entire net income. (8) For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"foreign person\" means: (A) an individual who is not a resident of the United States, (B) a foreign corporation, a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, as defined in section seventy-seven hundred one of the internal revenue code, other than a domestic branch thereof, (C) a foreign branch of a domestic corporation (including the taxpayer), (D) a foreign government or an international organization or an agency of either, or (E) an international banking facility.

Also, for purposes of clause (iv) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, loans made to finance the acquisition or development of land shall be deemed to be loans secured by an interest in residential real property if there is a reasonable assurance that the property will become residential real property within a period of three years from the date of acquisition of such land; but this sentence shall not apply for any taxable year unless, within such three year period, such land becomes residential real property. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under clause (vi) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, any regular interest in another REMIC held by such REMIC shall be treated as a loan described in a preceding clause under principles similar to the principle of such clause (vi); except that if such REMICS are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of such clause (vi). (2) For taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand ten, a thrift institution must exclude from the computation of its entire net income any amount allowed as a deduction for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 166, 585 or 593 of the internal revenue code. (3) For taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand ten, a thrift institution shall be allowed as a deduction in computing entire net income the amount of a reasonable addition to its reserve for bad debts. This amount shall be equal to the sum of (A) the amount determined to be a reasonable addition to the reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans, computed in the same manner as is provided with respect to additions to the reserves for losses on loans of banks under paragraph one of subdivision (i) of this section, plus (B) the amount determined by the taxpayer to be a reasonable addition to the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans, but such amount shall not exceed the amount determined under paragraph four or five of this subdivision, whichever is the larger, but the amount determined under this subparagraph shall in no case be greater than the larger of (i) the amount determined under paragraph five of this subdivision, or (ii) the amount which, when added to the amount determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, equals the amount by which twelve percent of the total deposits or withdrawable accounts of depositors of the taxpayer at the close of such year exceeds the sum of its surplus, undivided profits and reserves at the beginning of such year (taking into account any portion thereof attributable to the period before the first taxable year beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred fifty-one). The taxpayer must include in its tax return for each year a computation of the amount of the addition to the bad debt reserve determined under this subdivision. The use of a particular method in the return for a taxable year is not a binding election by the taxpayer. (4)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, the amount determined under this paragraph for the taxable year shall be an amount equal to thirty-two percent of the entire net income for such year. (B) The amount determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount determined under subparagraph (A) of paragraph three of this subdivision. (C) The amount determined under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount necessary to increase the balance at the close of the taxable year of the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans to six percent of such loans outstanding at such time. (D) For purposes of this paragraph, entire net income shall be computed (i) by excluding from income any amount included therein by reason of subparagraph (B) of paragraph eight of this subdivision, (ii) without regard to any deduction allowable for any addition to the reserve for bad debts, and (iii) by excluding from income an amount equal to the net gain for the taxable year arising from the sale or exchange of stock of a corporation or of obligations the interest on which is excludable from gross income under section 103 of the internal revenue code. (iv) Whenever a thrift institution is properly includable in a combined return, entire net income, for purposes of this paragraph, shall not exceed the lesser of the thrift institution's separately computed entire net income as adjusted pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph or the combined group's entire net income as adjusted pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph. (5) The amount determined under this paragraph for the taxable year shall be computed in the same manner as is provided under paragraph one of subdivision (i) of this section with respect to additions to reserves for losses on loans of banks. Provided, however, that for any taxable year beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-five, for purposes of such computation, the base year shall be the later of (A) the last taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred ninety-five or (B) the last taxable year before the current year in which the amount determined under the provisions of subparagraph (B) of paragraph three of this subdivision exceeded the amount allowable under this paragraph. (6) (A) (i) Each taxpayer described in paragraph one of this subdivision shall establish and maintain a New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans, a New York reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans and a supplemental reserve for losses on loans. Such reserves shall be maintained for all subsequent taxable years that this subdivision applies to the taxpayer. (ii) For purposes of this subdivision, such reserves shall be treated as reserves for bad debts, but no deduction shall be allowed for any addition to the supplemental reserve for losses on loans. (iii) Except as noted below, the balances of each such reserve at the beginning of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-five shall be the same as the balances maintained for federal income tax purposes in accordance with section 593(c)(1) of the internal revenue code as in existence on December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-five for the last day of the last tax year beginning before January first, nineteen hundred ninety-six. A taxpayer which maintained a New York reserve for loan losses on qualifying real property loans in the last tax year beginning before January first, nineteen hundred ninety-six shall have a continuation of such New York reserve balance in lieu of the amount determined under the preceding sentence. (iv) Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this subparagraph, any amount allocated to the reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans pursuant to section 593(c)(5) of the internal revenue code as in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 shall not be treated as a reserve for bad debts for any purpose other than determining the amount referred to in subparagraph (B) of paragraph three of this subdivision, and for such purpose such amount shall be treated as remaining in such reserve. (B) Any debt becoming worthless or partially worthless in respect of a qualifying real property loan shall be charged to the reserve for losses on such loans and any debt becoming worthless or partially worthless in respect of a nonqualifying loan shall be charged to the reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans, except that any such debt may, at the election of the taxpayer, be charged in whole or in part to the supplemental reserve for losses on loans. (C) The New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans shall be increased by the amount determined under subparagraph (B) of paragraph three of this subdivision and the New York reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans shall be increased by the amount determined under subparagraph (A) of paragraph three of this subdivision. (7)(A) For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"qualifying real property loan\" shall mean any loan secured by an interest in improved real property or secured by an interest in real property which is to be improved out of the proceeds of the loan. Such term shall include any mortgage-backed security which represents ownership of a fractional undivided interest in a trust, the assets of which consist primarily of mortgage loans, provided that the real property which serves as security for the loans is (or from the proceeds of the loan, will become) the type of property described in clauses (i) through (v) of subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision. However, such term shall not include: (i) any loan evidenced by a security (as defined in section 165(g)(2)(C) of the internal revenue code); (ii) any loan, whether or not evidenced by a security (as defined in such section 165(g)(2)(C)), the primary obligor of which is (I) a government or political subdivision or instrumentality thereof, (II) a banking corporation, or (III) any corporation sixty-five percent or more of whose voting stock is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer or by a banking corporation or bank holding company that owns or controls, directly or indirectly, sixty-five percent or more of the voting stock of the taxpayer; (iii) any loan, to the extent secured by a deposit in or share of the taxpayer; or (iv) any loan which, within a sixty-day period beginning in one taxable year of the creditor and ending in its next taxable year, is made or acquired and then repaid or disposed of, unless the transactions by which such loan was made or acquired and then repaid or disposed of are established to be for bona fide business purposes. (B) For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"nonqualifying loan\" shall mean any loan which is not a qualifying real property loan. (C) For purposes of this subdivision, the term \"loan\" shall mean debt, as the term \"debt\" is used in section 166 of the internal revenue code. (D) A regular or residual interest in a REMIC, as such term is defined in section 860D of the internal revenue code, shall be treated as a qualifying real property loan, except that, if less than ninety-five percent of the assets of such REMIC are qualifying real property loans (determined as if the taxpayer held the assets of the REMIC), such interest shall be so treated only in the proportion which the assets of such REMIC consist of such loans. For purposes of determining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any interest in another REMIC held by such REMIC shall be treated as a qualifying real property loan under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that if such REMICS are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of this paragraph. (8)(A) Any distribution of property (as defined in section 317(a) of the internal revenue code) by a thrift institution to a shareholder with respect to its stock, if such distribution is not allowable as a deduction under section 591 of such code, shall be treated as made (i) first out of its New York earnings and profits accumulated in taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred fifty-one, to the extent thereof, (ii) then out of the New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans, to the extent additions to such reserve exceed the additions which would have been allowed under paragraph five of this subdivision, (iii) then out of the supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent thereof, (iv) then out of such other accounts as may be proper. This subparagraph shall apply in the case of any distribution in redemption of stock or in partial or complete liquidation of a thrift institution, except that any such distribution shall be treated as made first out of the amount referred to in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, second out of the amount referred to in clause (iii) of this subparagraph, third out of the amount referred to in clause (i) of this subparagraph and then out of such other accounts as may be proper. This subparagraph shall not apply to any transaction to which section 381 of such code (relating to carryovers and certain corporate acquisitions) applies, or to any distribution to the federal savings and loan insurance corporation or the federal deposit insurance corporation in redemption of an interest in an association or institution, if such interest was originally received by the federal savings and loan insurance corporation or the federal deposit insurance corporation in exchange for financial assistance pursuant to section 406(f) of the federal national housing act or pursuant to subsection (c) of section thirteen of the federal deposit insurance act. (B) If any distribution is treated under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph as having been made out of the reserves described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of such subparagraph, the amount charged against such reserve shall be the amount which, when reduced by the amount of tax imposed under the internal revenue code and attributable to the inclusion of such amount in gross income, is equal to the amount of such distribution; and the amount so charged against such reserve shall be included in the entire net income of the taxpayer. (C) (i) For purposes of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, additions to the New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans for the taxable year in which the distribution occurs shall be taken into account. (ii) For purposes of computing under this subdivision the amount of a reasonable addition to the New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans for any taxable year, the amount charged during any year to such reserve pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall not be taken into account. (9) A taxpayer which maintains a New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans and which ceases to meet the definition of a thrift institution as defined in paragraph one of this subdivision, must include in its entire net income for the last taxable year such paragraph applied the excess of its New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans over the greater of (A) its reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans as of the last day of the last taxable year such reserve is maintained for federal income tax purposes or (B) the balance of the New York reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans which would be allowable to the taxpayer for the last taxable year such taxpayer met such definition of a thrift institution if the taxpayer had computed its reserve balance pursuant to the method described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of subdivision (i) of this section. (i) (1) For taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand ten, a taxpayer subject to the provisions of section 585(c) of the internal revenue code and not subject to subdivision (h) of this section may, in computing entire net income, deduct an amount equal to or less than the amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, whichever is greater. Provided, however, in no event shall the deduction be less than the amount determined pursuant to such subparagraph (A). (A) The amount determined pursuant to this subparagraph shall be the amount necessary to increase the balance of its New York reserve for losses on loans (at the close of the taxable year) to the amount which bears the same ratio to loans outstanding at the close of the taxable year as (i) the total bad debts sustained during the taxable year and the five preceding taxable years (or, with the approval of the commissioner of finance, a shorter period), adjusted for recoveries of bad debts during such period, bears to (ii) the sum of the loans outstanding at the close of such six or fewer taxable years. (B)(i) The amount determined pursuant to this subparagraph shall be the amount necessary to increase the balance of its New York reserve for losses on loans (at the close of the taxable year) to the lower of -- (I) the balance of the reserve at the close of the base year, or (II) if the amount of loans outstanding at the close of the taxable year is less than the amount of loans outstanding at the close of the base year, the amount which bears the same ratio to loans outstanding at the close of the taxable year as the balance of the reserve at the close of the base year bears to the amount of loans outstanding at the close of the base year. (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the base year shall be (I) for taxable years beginning in nineteen hundred eighty-seven, the last taxable year before the most recent adoption of the experience method for federal income tax purposes or for purposes of this part, whichever is earlier, and (II) for taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred eighty-seven, the last taxable year beginning before nineteen hundred eighty-eight. (2) (A) For taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand ten, each taxpayer described in paragraph one of this subdivision shall establish and maintain a New York reserve for losses on loans. Such reserve shall be maintained for all subsequent taxable years. The balance of the New York reserve for losses on loans at the beginning of the first day of the first taxable year the taxpayer becomes subject to this subdivision shall be the same as the balance at the beginning of such day of the reserve for losses on loans maintained for federal income tax purposes. The New York reserve for losses on loans shall be reduced by an amount equal to the deduction allowed, but not more than the amount allowable, for worthless debts for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 166 of the internal revenue code plus the amount, if any, charged against its reserve for losses on loans pursuant to section 585(c)(4) of such code. (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a taxpayer which had previously been subject to the provisions of subdivision (h) of this section shall establish a New York reserve for losses on loans equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (I) the balance of its federal reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans as of the first day of the first taxable year the taxpayer becomes subject to the provisions of this subdivision or (II) the greater of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph nine of subdivision (h) of this section in the year such paragraph applied to the taxpayer, (ii) the greater of (I) the balance in its federal reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans as of the first day of the first taxable year the taxpayer becomes subject to this subdivision or (II) the balance in its New York reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans as of the last date the taxpayer was subject to the provisions of subdivision (h) of this section, and (iii) the balance in its supplemental reserve for losses on loans as of the last date the taxpayer was subject to the provisions of subdivision (h) of this section. (3) The determination and treatment of the New York reserve balance, including any additions thereto, subtractions therefrom, or recapture thereof, for (A) any banking corporation which was subject to tax for federal income tax purposes but not subject to tax under this part for prior taxable years, (B) any taxpayer which ceases to be subject to tax under this part, or (C) any other unusual circumstances shall be determined by the commissioner of finance. Provided, however, any banking corporation which was subject to tax for federal income tax purposes but not subject to tax under this part for prior taxable years shall have as its opening New York reserve for losses on loans the amount determined by applying the provisions of subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of this subdivision to loans outstanding at the close of its last taxable year for federal income tax purposes ending prior to the first taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to tax under this part and provided, further, that the provisions of subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision shall not apply. (j) (1) For any taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred seventy-three or for any period for which a tax is imposed under subdivision (b) of section 11-639 of this part, entire net income shall be computed without regard to the amount allowable as a deduction for bad debts or an addition to a reserve for bad debts in computing federal taxable income for the taxable year, but, in lieu thereof, a deduction shall be allowed to the extent and in the manner authorized by subdivision five of section 11-621 or subdivision (e) of section 11-629 of this subchapter as if such provisions were set forth in full in this part and by treating such provisions as applicable under this part. (2) In the case of property placed in service prior to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-three, for which the taxpayer properly adopted a different method of computing depreciation under section 11-621 or section 11-629 of this subchapter than was adopted for federal income tax purposes with respect to such property, entire net income under this part shall be computed without regard to the amount allowable as a deduction for depreciation of such property in computing federal taxable income for the taxable year but, in lieu thereof, shall be computed as if such deduction were determined by the method of depreciation adopted with respect to such property under section 11-621 or 11-629 of this subchapter. (3) In computing entire net income, the amount allowable as a deduction for charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes shall be: (a) increased for the first taxable year or period beginning in nineteen hundred seventy-three by the amount of any contributions made during such taxable year or period which were not allowable as a deduction for charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes for such taxable year or period because of an election pursuant to paragraph two of subsection (a) of section one hundred seventy of the internal revenue code and which were not deductible in computing the tax due under part one or two of this subchapter three, and (b) decreased by any amount allowed as a deduction for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year under section one hundred seventy of the internal revenue code as a carryover of excess contributions which are not made in such taxable year and which were deductible in computing the tax due under part one or two of this subchapter three. (4) There shall be excluded from the computation of entire net income any amount allowed as a deduction for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year under section twelve hundred twelve of the internal revenue code as a capital loss carry forward to the taxable year, which was deductible as a loss in computing the tax due under part one or two of this subchapter three. (5) There shall be excluded from the computation of entire net income the amount of any income or gain from the sale of real or personal property which is includible in determining federal taxable income for the taxable year pursuant to the installment method under section four hundred fifty-three of the internal revenue code, to the extent that such income or gain was includible in the computation of the tax due under part one or two of this subchapter three. (6) To the extent not otherwise provided in this part, there shall be excluded from entire net income the amount necessary to prevent the taxation under this part of any other amount of income or gain which was properly included in income or gain and was taxable under part one or two of this subchapter three and there shall be disallowed as a deduction in computing entire net income any amount which was allowed as a deduction in computing the tax due under such parts. (k) (1) At the election of the taxpayer, there shall be deducted from the portion of its entire net income allocated within the city, depreciation with respect to any property such as described in paragraph two of this subdivision, not exceeding twice the depreciation allowed with respect to the same property for federal income tax purposes. Such deduction shall be allowed only upon condition that entire net income be computed without any deduction for depreciation or amortization of the same property, and the total of all deductions allowed under parts one and two of this subchapter three and this part in any taxable year or years with respect to the depreciaton of any such property shall not exceed its cost or other basis. (2) Such deduction shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in this city and used in the taxpayer's business, (i) constructed, reconstructed or erected after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or, property, the physical construction, reconstruction or erection of which began on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven or which began after such date pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or (ii) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in this city and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or (iii) acquired, constructed, reconstructed, or erected subsequent to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, if such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection is pursuant to a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven and not thereafter substantially modified, and such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection would qualify under the rules in paragraph four, five or six of subsection (h) of section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references in such paragraphs four, five and six to the dates October nine, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven. A taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be delivered or the construction, reconstruction or erection shall be completed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine, except in the case of tangible property which is acquired, constructed, reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer. Provided, however, for any taxable year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph one hereof with respect to tangible personal property leased by it to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which the taxpayer uses itself for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, the taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under paragraph one in proportion to the part of the year it uses such property. (3) If the deduction allowable for any taxable year pursuant to this subdivision exceeds the portion of the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to this city for such year, the excess may be carried over to the following taxable year or years and may be deducted from the portion of the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to this city for such year or years. (4) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to this subdivision, subdivision twelve of section 11-621 or subdivision (j) of section 11-629 of this subchapter, the gain or loss entering into the computation of federal taxable income shall be disregarded in computing entire net income, and there shall be added or subtracted from the portion of entire net income allocated within the city the gain or loss upon such sale or other disposition. In computing such gain or loss the basis of the property sold or disposed of shall be adjusted to reflect the deduction allowed with respect to such property pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision. Provided, however, that no loss shall be recognized for the purposes of this paragraph with respect to a sale or other disposition of property to a person whose acquisition thereof is not a purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code. (k-1) A net operating loss deduction shall be allowed which shall be presumably the same as the net operating loss deduction allowed under section one hundred seventy-two of the internal revenue code, except that in every instance where such deduction is allowed under this subchapter: (1) any net operating loss included in determining such deduction shall be adjusted to reflect the inclusions and exclusions from entire net income required by the other provisions of this section; (2) such deduction shall not include any net operating loss sustained during any taxable year beginning prior to January first, two thousand nine, or during any taxable year in which the taxpayer was not subject to the tax imposed by this subchapter; (3) such deduction shall not exceed the deduction for the taxable year allowed under section one hundred seventy-two of the internal revenue code augmented by the excess of the amount allowed as a deduction pursuant to subdivision (h) or (i) of this section, whichever is applicable, over the amount allowed as a deduction pursuant to section one hundred sixty-six or five hundred eighty-five of the internal revenue code, for each taxable year in which the taxpayer had a net operating loss which is carried to the taxable year of the deduction under this provision, in the aggregate, (except to the extent such excess was previously deducted in computing entire net income); and (4) the net operating loss deduction allowed under section one hundred seventy-two of the internal revenue code shall for purposes of this subdivision be determined as if the taxpayer had elected under such section to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to net operating losses. (l) If the period covered by a return under this part is other than the period covered by the return to the United States treasury department, entire net income and alternative entire net income shall be determined by multiplying the taxable income reported to such department (as adjusted pursuant to the provisions of this part) by the number of calendar months or major parts thereof covered by the return under this part and dividing by the number of calendar months or major parts thereof covered by the return to such department. If it shall appear that such method of determining entire net income or alternative entire net income does not properly reflect the taxpayer's income during the period covered by the return under this part, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized in his or her discretion to determine such entire net income or alternative entire net income solely on the basis of the taxpayer's income during the period covered by its return under this part. (m) The commissioner of finance, may, whenever necessary in order properly to reflect the entire net income of any taxpayer, determine the year or period in which any item of income or deduction shall be included, without regard to the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer. * (n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, for taxable years beginning on or after August first, two thousand two, in the case of a taxpayer that is a partner in a partnership subject to the tax imposed by chapter eleven of this title as a utility, as defined in subdivision six of section 11-1101 of such chapter, entire net income shall not include the taxpayer's distributive or pro rata share for federal income tax purposes of any item of income, gain, loss or deduction of such partnership, or any item of income, gain, loss or deduction of such partnership that the taxpayer is required to take into account separately for federal income tax purposes. * NB There are 2 sub (n)'s * (n) for taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand one, in the case of qualified property described in paragraph two of subsection k of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code, other than qualified resurgence zone property described in subdivision (p) of this section, and other than qualified New York Liberty Zone property described in paragraph two of subsection b of section fourteen hundred L of the internal revenue code (without regard to clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of such paragraph), a taxpayer shall be allowed with respect to such property the depreciation deduction allowable under section one hundred sixty-seven as such section would have applied to such property had it been acquired by the taxpayer on September tenth, two thousand one, provided, however, that for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand four, in the case of a passenger motor vehicle or a sport utility vehicle subject to the provisions of subdivision (r) of this section, the limitation under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of subdivision (a) of section two hundred eighty F of the internal revenue code applicable to the amount allowed as a deduction under this paragraph shall be determined as of the date such vehicle was placed in service and not as of September tenth, two thousand one. * NB There are 2 sub (n)'s (o) for taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand one, upon the disposition of property to which subdivision (n) of this section applies, the amount of any gain or loss includible in entire net income shall be adjusted to reflect the inclusions and exclusions from entire net income pursuant to paragraph thirteen of subdivision (b) and subdivision (n) of this section attributable to such property. (p) for purposes of subdivisions (n) and (o) of this section, qualified resurgence zone property shall mean qualified property described in paragraph two of subsection k of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code substantially all of the use of which is in the resurgence zone, as defined below, and is in the active conduct of a trade or business by the taxpayer in such zone, and the original use of which in the resurgence zone commences with the taxpayer after September tenth, two thousand one. The resurgence zone shall mean the area of New York county bounded on the south by a line running from the intersection of the Hudson River with the Holland Tunnel, and running thence east to Canal Street, then running along the centerline of Canal Street to the intersection of the Bowery and Canal Street, running thence in a southeasterly direction diagonally across Manhattan Bridge Plaza, to the Manhattan Bridge, and thence along the centerline of the Manhattan Bridge to the point where the centerline of the Manhattan Bridge would intersect with the easterly bank of the East River, and bounded on the north by a line running from the intersection of the Hudson River with the Holland Tunnel and running thence north along West Avenue to the intersection of Clarkson Street then running east along the centerline of Clarkson Street to the intersection of Washington Avenue, then running south along the centerline of Washington Avenue to the intersection of West Houston Street, then east along the centerline of West Houston Street, then at the intersection of the Avenue of the Americas continuing east along the centerline of East Houston Street to the easterly bank of the East River. (q) Related members expense add back. (1) Definitions. (A) Related member. \"Related member\" means a related person as defined in subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four hundred sixty-five of the internal revenue code, except that \"fifty percent\" shall be substituted for \"ten percent\". (B) Effective rate of tax. \"Effective rate of tax\" means, as to any city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by the city on or measured by a related member's net income multiplied by the apportionment percentage, if any, applicable to the related member under the laws of said jurisdiction. For purposes of this definition, the effective rate of tax as to any city is zero where the related member's net income tax liability in said city is reported on a combined or consolidated return including both the taxpayer and the related member where the reported transactions between the taxpayer and the related member are eliminated or offset. Also, for purposes of this definition, when computing the effective rate of tax for a city in which a related member's net income is eliminated or offset by a credit or similar adjustment that is dependent upon the related member either maintaining or managing intangible property or collecting interest income in that city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by said city shall be decreased to reflect the statutory rate of tax that applies to the related member as effectively reduced by such credit or similar adjustment. (C) Royalty payments. Royalty payments are payments directly connected to the acquisition, use, maintenance or management, ownership, sale, exchange, or any other disposition of licenses, trademarks, copyrights, trade names, trade dress, service marks, mask works, trade secrets, patents and any other similar types of intangible assets as determined by the commissioner of finance, and include amounts allowable as interest deductions under section one hundred sixty-three of the internal revenue code to the extent such amounts are directly or indirectly for, related to or in connection with the acquisition, use, maintenance or management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of such intangible assets. (D) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is one or more business purposes, other than the avoidance or reduction of taxation, which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction changes in a meaningful way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase in the market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the taxpayer into new business markets. (2) Royalty expense add backs. (A) For the purpose of computing entire net income, a taxpayer must add back royalty payments directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred in connection with one or more direct or indirect transactions with one or more related members during the taxable year to the extent deductible in calculating federal taxable income. (B) Exceptions. (i) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply to the portion of the royalty payment that the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, meets all of the following requirements: (I) the related member was subject to tax in this city or another city within the United States or a foreign nation or some combination thereof on a tax base that included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer; (II) the related member during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued or incurred such portion to a person that is not a related member; and (III) the transaction giving rise to the royalty payment between the taxpayer and the related member was undertaken for a valid business purpose. (ii) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the related member was subject to tax on or measured by its net income in this city or another city within the United States, or some combination thereof; (II) the tax base for said tax included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer; and (III) the aggregate effective rate of tax applied to the related member in those jurisdictions is no less than eighty percent of the statutory rate of tax that applied to the taxpayer under section 11-643.5 of this part for the taxable year. (iii) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred to a related member organized under the laws of a country other than the United States; (II) the related member's income from the transaction was subject to a comprehensive income tax treaty between such country and the United States; (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign nation on a tax base that included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer; (IV) the related member's income from the transaction was taxed in such country at an effective rate of tax at least equal to that imposed by this city; and (V) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred pursuant to a transaction that was undertaken for a valid business purpose and using terms that reflect an arm's length relationship. (iv) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance agree in writing to the application or use of alternative adjustments or computations. The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, agree to the application or use of alternative adjustments or computations when he or she concludes that in the absence of such agreement the income of the taxpayer would not be properly reflected. (r) For taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand four, in the case of a taxpayer that is not an eligible farmer as defined in subsection (n) of section six hundred six of the tax law, a taxpayer shall be allowed with respect to a sport utility vehicle that is not a passenger automobile as defined in paragraph five of subsection (d) of section two hundred eighty F of the internal revenue code, the deductions allowable under sections one hundred seventy-nine, one hundred sixty-seven and one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code, determined as if such sport utility vehicle were a passenger automobile as defined in such paragraph five. (s) Upon the disposition of property to which subdivision (r) of this section applies, the amount of any gain or loss includible in entire net income shall be adjusted to reflect the modification provided in such subdivision attributable to such property.
