Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to limit the rights conferred by section 11-332 of this chapter on the holder of a tax lien certificate with respect to a subsequent tax lien. b. The commissioner of finance, on behalf of the city, may sell tax liens, either individually, in combinations, or in the aggregate, pursuant to the procedures provided herein. The commissioner of finance shall establish the terms and conditions of a sale of a tax lien or tax liens. Enactment of the local law that added this sentence shall be deemed to constitute authorization by the council for the commissioner of finance to conduct a sale or sales of tax liens through and including December thirty-first, two thousand fourteen. Subsequent to December thirty-first, two thousand fourteen, the city shall not have the authority to sell tax liens. 1. (i) The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, sell a tax lien or tax liens through a competitive sale. In addition to the advertisement and notice required to be provided pursuant to section 11-320 of this chapter, the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall cause to be published a notice of intention to sell a tax lien or tax liens through a competitive sale, which notice shall include the terms and conditions for such sale, the criteria by which bids shall be evaluated, and a request for any other information or documents that the commissioner of finance may require. Such notice shall be published in one newspaper of general circulation in the city, not less than fifteen days prior to the date designated by the commissioner for the submission of bids. (ii) The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, establish criteria for the eligibility of bidders pursuant to section 11-321.1 of this chapter. (iii) The commissioner of finance may reject any or all bids, or may accept any combination of bids in a competitive sale. 2. (i) The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, sell a tax lien or tax liens through a negotiated sale. In addition to the advertisement and notice required to be provided pursuant to section 11-320 of this chapter, the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall cause to be published a notice of intention to sell a tax lien or tax liens through a negotiated sale, which notice shall advise that a request for statements of interest is available at the office of the department of finance, and which may require the submission of any information or documents that the commissioner deems appropriate, provided, however, that if the negotiated sale is to a trust or other entity created by the city or in which the city has an ownership or residual interest, then the requirement that the notice advise that a request for statements of interest is available at the office of the department of finance shall not apply. Such notice shall be published in one newspaper of general circulation in the city, not less than fifteen days prior to the date designated by the commissioner for the receipt of statements of interest, or if the negotiated sale is to such trust or other entity, then such notice shall be published not less than fifteen days prior to the date of sale. For purposes of this subparagraph, the words \"date of sale\" shall have the same meaning provided in subdivision e of section 11-320 of this chapter. (ii) The commissioner of finance may engage in a negotiated sale in accordance with criteria to be established pursuant to section 11-321.1 of this chapter. (iii) The commissioner of finance may execute a purchase and sale agreement and other necessary agreements with a designated purchaser or purchasers to complete a negotiated sale. 3. The commissioner of finance may establish a minimum price for the sale of tax liens that may be at a discount from or premium to the lien amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the commissioner of finance may not establish a minimum price for the sale of an individual tax lien that is at a discount from the lien amount. The commissioner of finance shall sell such tax liens at a purchase price that, in the determination of such commissioner, is in the best interests of the city. The commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion, may accept cash or cash equivalent in immediately available funds, or other consideration acceptable to the commissioner, or any combination thereof in payment for a tax lien or tax liens. 4. The amount of a tax lien that is sold pursuant to this chapter shall be the unpaid amount of the lien as of the date of sale, including any interest and penalties thereon, any taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, any surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and interest and penalties thereon, or such component of the amount thereof as shall be determined by the commissioner of finance, notwithstanding the amount paid for purchase of the tax lien or component of the amount thereof. For purposes of this paragraph, the words, \"date of sale\" shall have the same meaning provided in section 11-320(e) of this chapter. 5. (i) The commissioner of finance may, subsequent to the offer for sale of any tax lien or tax liens and the failure to complete such sale, offer such tax lien or tax liens for sale again to any other person or persons who satisfied the terms and conditions of the sale without providing any additional advertisements or notices pursuant to this chapter. (ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, any tax lien that was noticed for sale pursuant to this chapter, but was not sold on the original date of sale, may be sold without any additional advertisements or notices pursuant to this chapter if the subsequent date of sale is within six months of the second publication, pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the notice of the original date of sale. If the subsequent date of sale is more than six months after the second publication, pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the notice of the original date of sale, then the commissioner of finance, or his or her designee, shall provide notice of the subsequent date of sale pursuant to subdivision b of section 11-320 of this chapter. No other additional advertisements or notices shall be necessary prior to the date of sale. 6. The rate of interest on any tax lien certificate shall be the rate adopted for nonpayment of taxes on real property pursuant to subdivision (e) of section 11-224.1 of this title on the effective date of the local law that added this sentence. 7. It is the intent of the city that a sale of a tax lien or tax liens pursuant to this chapter shall be a sale and not a borrowing. 8. Whenever any tax lien purchased at a tax lien sale is found to be invalid, void or defective in whole or in part, or not to conform to any representation or warranty with respect thereto, made by the commissioner of finance in connection with the sale thereof, by judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction or by determination of the commissioner of finance, the commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, substitute for such tax lien or portion thereof another tax lien that has a value equivalent to the value of the tax lien or portion thereof found to be invalid, void, defective, or not to so conform, or may refund such value of the tax lien or portion thereof found to be invalid, void, defective, or not to so conform, or may use a combination of substitution and refund. No other remedy shall be available to a purchaser of a tax lien which is found to be invalid, void, defective, or not to conform to a representation or warranty with respect thereto made by the commissioner of finance in connection with the sale thereof, in whole or in part. Whenever a tax lien of such equivalent value is to be substituted for a tax lien that has been found invalid, void, defective, or not to so conform, in whole or in part, pursuant to this section, the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall provide mailed notice of the intention to substitute such lien of such equivalent value to any person required to be notified pursuant to section 11-320(b) of this chapter. 9. The commissioner of finance may establish requirements for a purchaser of a tax lien to provide any information and documents that the commissioner of finance deems necessary, including information concerning the collection and enforcement of tax liens. The commissioner of finance shall require the purchaser of a tax lien to provide the owner of property on which a tax lien has been sold pursuant to this chapter a detailed itemization of taxes, interest, surcharges, and fees charged to such owner on all tax lien statements of amounts due or bill of charges. Such fees shall be bona fide, reasonable and, in the case of attorney fees, customary. 10. (i) Before January first, two thousand twelve, any tax lien or tax liens that are sold pursuant to this chapter on property owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law shall be deemed defective. On and after January first, two thousand twelve, any tax lien or tax liens that are sold pursuant to this chapter on any class two residential property owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative, shall be deemed defective. For the purposes of this paragraph, property owned by such company shall be limited to property owned for the purpose, as set forth in section five hundred seventy-one of the state private housing finance law, of providing housing for families and persons of low income. (ii) No later than May first, two thousand eleven, the commissioner of finance, in consultation with the commissioner of housing preservation and development, shall notify by mail any class two residential property owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law that is not a residential condominium or residential cooperative, of the authority of the commissioner of finance to sell the tax liens on such property. Such notification shall include information relating to the lien sale process, including, but not limited to, actions homeowners can take if a lien is sold on such property; the type of debt that can be sold in a lien sale; a timeline of statutory notifications required pursuant to section 11-320 of this chapter; a clear, concise explanation of the consequences of the sale of a tax lien; the telephone number and electronic mail address of the employee or employees designated pursuant to subdivision f of section 11-320 of this chapter; a conspicuous statement that the owner of the property may enter into a payment plan for exclusion from the tax lien sale; and credits and property tax exemptions that may exclude a property from a tax lien sale and any other credit or residential real property tax exemption information, which, in the discretion of the commissioner, should be included in such notification. Upon such property owner's written request, or verbal request to 311 or any employee designated pursuant to subdivision f of section 11-320 of this chapter, a Chinese, Korean, Russian or Spanish translation of such notice shall be provided promptly to such property owner. 11.
