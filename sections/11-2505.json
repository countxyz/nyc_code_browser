  "text": "ยง 11-2505 Payment of tax. At the time of filing a return of occupancy and of rents each operator and room remarketer shall pay to the commissioner of finance the taxes imposed by this chapter upon the rents required to be included in such return, as well as all other moneys collected by the operator or room remarketer acting or purporting to act under the provisions of this chapter, even though it be judicially determined that the tax collected is invalidly imposed. All the taxes for the period for which a return is required to be filed shall be due from the operator or room remarketer and payable to the commissioner of finance on the date limited for the filing of the return for such period, without regard to whether a return is filed or whether the return which is filed correctly shows the amount of rents and the taxes due thereon. Where the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion deems it necessary to protect revenues to be obtained under this chapter he or she may require any operator or room remarketer required to collect the tax imposed by this chapter to file with him or her a bond, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as the commissioner of finance may fix, to secure the payment of any tax and/or penalties and interest due or which may become due from such operator or room remarketer. In the event that the commissioner of finance determines that an operator or room remarketer is to file such bond he or she shall give notice to such operator or room remarketer to that effect specifying the amount of the bond required. The operator or room remarketer shall file such bond within five days after the giving of such notice unless within such five days the operator or room remarketer shall request in writing a hearing before the commissioner of finance at which the necessity, propriety and amount of the bond shall be determined by the commissioner of finance. Such determination shall be final and shall be complied with within fifteen days after the giving of notice thereof. In lieu of such bond, securities approved by the commissioner of finance or cash in such amount as he or she may prescribe, may be deposited which shall be kept in the custody of the commissioner of finance who may at any time without notice to the depositor apply them to any tax and/or interest or penalties due, and for that purpose the securities may be sold by him or her at public or private sale without notice to the depositor thereof.
