If it shall appear that such method of determining entire net income does not properly reflect the taxpayer's income during the period covered by the report under this subchapter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized in his or her discretion to determine such entire net income solely on the basis of the taxpayer's income during the period covered by its report under this subchapter.

(l) for taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand one, upon the disposition of property to which paragraph (k) of this subdivision applies, the amount of any gain or loss includible in entire net income shall be adjusted to reflect the inclusions and exclusions from entire net income pursuant to subparagraph twelve of paragraph (a) and subparagraph sixteen of paragraph (b) of this subdivision attributable to such property.

(D) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is one or more business purposes, other than the avoidance or reduction of taxation, which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction changes in a meaningful way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase in the market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the taxpayer into new business markets. (2) Royalty expense add backs.

(iii) The adjustment required in this paragraph shall not apply if the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that: (I) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred to a related member organized under the laws of a country other than the United States; (II) the related member's income from the transaction was subject to a comprehensive income tax treaty between such country and the United States; (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign nation on a tax base that included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer; (IV) the related member's income from the transaction was taxed in such country at an effective rate of tax at least equal to that imposed by this city; and (V) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred pursuant to a transaction that was undertaken for a valid business purpose and using terms that reflect an arm's length relationship. (iv) The adjustment required in this paragraph shall not apply if the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance agree in writing to the application or use of alternative adjustments or computations. The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, agree to the application or use of alternative adjustments or computations when he or she concludes that in the absence of such agreement the income of the taxpayer would not be properly reflected.
