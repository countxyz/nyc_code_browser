  "text": "Civil actions for false claims. a. If the corporation counsel finds that a person has violated or is violating the provisions of section 7-803 of this chapter, he or she may institute a civil enforcement action against that person in any court of competent jurisdiction. b. 1. Any person may submit a proposed civil complaint to the city alleging violations of section 7-803. Proposed civil complaints shall be signed and verified and shall include all material evidence and information possessed by such person in support of the allegations in such proposed civil complaints. The city shall diligently investigate all such proposed civil complaints. The city may request such additional information as it deems necessary from the person submitting a proposed civil complaint. 2. The corporation counsel and the commissioner of investigation shall promulgate rules establishing a protocol detailing the procedures by which the city will address proposed civil complaints after they have been submitted, which protocol shall include the requirement that within one hundred eighty days of receipt of a proposed civil complaint, the city shall, in writing, notify the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint that the corporation counsel: (i) intends to commence a civil enforcement action based on the facts alleged in the proposed civil complaint against one or more of the defendants named in the proposed civil complaint, in which case he or she shall commence such action within ninety days of such notification, provided that if the corporation counsel determines that a delay in commencing such action is warranted, he or she may delay such commencement, upon notice to the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint, for an additional ninety days at which time he or she shall commence such action; (ii) designates the person or, if the person is not an attorney, the attorney of such person, as a special assistant corporation counsel for purposes of filing a civil enforcement action against one or more of the defendants named in the proposed civil complaint; or (iii) declines to commence a civil enforcement action or designate such person to commence a civil enforcement action in which case the corporation counsel shall state in the notification its reason for doing so. 3. The corporation counsel shall commence a civil enforcement action or designate the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint or, if the person is not an attorney, his or her attorney, to commence a civil enforcement action unless: (i) the proposed civil complaint is barred for the reasons set forth in subdivision d of this section; (ii) the corporation counsel has determined that the proposed civil complaint is based upon an interpretation of law or regulation which if adopted, would result in significant cost to the city; (iii) the corporation counsel has determined that commencing a civil enforcement action would interfere with a contractual relationship between the city and an entity providing goods or services which would significantly interfere with the provision of important goods or services, or would jeopardize the health and safety of the public; or (iv) the corporation counsel has determined that the complaint, if filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, would be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be based. c. If the commissioner of investigation determines that a civil enforcement action may interfere with or jeopardize an investigation by a governmental agency, then the corporation counsel may decline to commence a civil enforcement action based on a proposed civil complaint or to designate the person who submitted such proposed civil complaint to commence such action, provided that the corporation counsel notifies the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint of such determination within ninety days of receipt by the city of such proposed civil complaint and every one hundred eighty days thereafter until such time as the commissioner of investigation determines that such civil enforcement action would no longer interfere with or jeopardize a governmental investigation, at which time the corporation counsel shall provide to the person who submitted the proposed complaint the notification required in paragraph two of subdivision b of this section. The determination by the commissioner of investigation shall be final. d. Certain actions barred. This section shall not apply to claims, records, or statements made pursuant to federal, state or local tax law nor to any proposed civil complaints: 1. based upon one or more false claims with a cumulative value of less than twenty five thousand dollars; 2. based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of any pending criminal or civil action or proceeding, including a civil enforcement action, or an administrative action in which the city is already a party; 3. if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the proposed complaint were publicly disclosed (i) in a criminal, civil or administrative hearing; (ii) in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit or investigation; or (iii) by the news media and likely to be seen by the city officials responsible for addressing false claims; unless the person who submitted the proposed complaint is an original source of the information. The corporation counsel may, in his or her absolute discretion, waive the application of this paragraph. 4. based upon information discovered by an employee of the city, state or federal government in the course of his or her employment unless: (i) such employee first reported such information to the department of investigation; and (ii) the city failed to act on the information within six months of its receipt by the department of investigation; or 5. against the federal government, the state of New York, the city or any officer or employee acting within the scope of his or her employment. e. Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing anyone other than the corporation counsel and a person or attorney authorized pursuant to this chapter to commence a civil enforcement action to represent the city of New York in legal proceedings. f. Pending and related actions. 1. No person, other than the corporation counsel, may intervene or bring a related action based upon the facts underlying a civil enforcement action, unless such other person has first obtained the permission of the corporation counsel to intervene or to bring such related action. 2. Regardless of whether the corporation counsel has commenced a civil enforcement action or another party has been designated to do so, the city may elect to pursue any alternate action with respect to the presentation of false claims, provided that the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint upon which such alternate action is based, if any, shall be entitled to the same percentage share of any cash proceeds recovered by the city as such person would have been entitled to if such alternate action was a civil enforcement action. g. Rights of the parties. 1. If the corporation counsel elects to commence a civil enforcement action, then the city shall have the sole authority for prosecuting, and, subject to the approval of the comptroller, settling the action and may move to dismiss the action, or may settle the action notwithstanding the objections of the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint upon which such civil enforcement action is based. 2. If a person who submitted a proposed complaint or his or her attorney has been designated to commence a civil enforcement action, then the corporation counsel and such authorized person or attorney shall share authority for prosecuting the case. However, the corporation counsel may move to dismiss the action notwithstanding the objection of the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint provided such person has been served with an appropriate motion and the court has provided such person with an opportunity to be heard. The corporation counsel may also, subject to the approval of the comptroller, settle the action notwithstanding the objection of the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint if the court determines after providing such person with an opportunity to be heard, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable. 3. The corporation counsel may apply to the court for and the court may issue an order restricting the participation of a person designated to commence a civil enforcement action in such litigation notwithstanding the objections of such person if the court determines, after providing such person an opportunity to be heard, that such person's unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation would interfere with or unduly delay the prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious or irrelevant, or upon a showing by the defendant that such person's unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden. Such restrictions may include, but need not be limited to: (i) limiting the number of witnesses such person may call, (ii) limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses, (iii) limiting such person's cross-examination of witnesses, or (iv) otherwise limiting such person's participation in the litigation. 4. The corporation counsel may apply to the court for a stay of any civil enforcement action if it will interfere with any investigation or prosecution of a criminal matter arising out of the same facts. h. Under no circumstances shall the city be bound by an act of a person designated to commence a civil enforcement action. i. Awards from proceeds. 1. If the corporation counsel has elected to commence a civil enforcement action based on a proposed civil complaint, then the person or persons who submitted such proposed civil complaint collectively shall be entitled to receive between fifteen and twenty-five percent of the proceeds recovered in such civil enforcement action or in settlement of such action. Where the court finds that the action was based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil or administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than ten percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person or persons who submitted the proposed civil complaint in advancing the case to litigation. 2. If a person, or such person's attorney has been designated to commence a civil enforcement action based on such person's proposed civil complaint, then such person shall be entitled to receive between twenty-five and thirty percent of the proceeds recovered in such civil enforcement action or in settlement of such action. 3. The court shall determine the share of the proceeds to which a person submitting a proposed complaint is entitled, and may take into account the following factors: (i) the extent to which the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint contributed to the prosecution of the action, either in time, effort or finances; (ii) whether the civil enforcement action was based primarily on information provided by the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint, rather than information derived from public sources such as allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil or administrative hearing, in a legislative or administrative report, hearing, audit or investigation, or from the news media; (iii) any unreasonable delay by such person in submitting the proposed civil complaint; (iv) the extent to which the allegations involve a significant safety issue; (v) whether the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint that formed the basis of the civil enforcement action initiated the violation of section 7-803 of this chapter alleged in such action, in which case the percentage share of the proceeds of the action that such person would otherwise receive under this section may be reduced below the minimum percentages set forth in paragraphs one and two of this subdivision, taking into account the role of such person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances including those pertaining to the violation; (vi) whether the person who submitted the proposed civil complaint that formed the basis of the civil enforcement action has been charged with criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the alleged violation of section 7-803 of this chapter, in which case such person shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action if convicted on such charges; and (vii) fundamental fairness and any other factors the corporation counsel and the court deem appropriate. j. Costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. 1. In any civil enforcement action commenced pursuant to this chapter, the corporation counsel, or a person designated to commence such civil enforcement action, if applicable, may apply for an amount of reasonable expenses, plus reasonable attorneys' fees, plus costs. Costs and expenses shall include costs incurred by the department of investigation in investigating the false claim and prosecuting conduct relating thereto. All such expenses, attorneys' fees and costs shall be awarded directly against the defendant and shall not be charged from the proceeds, but shall only be awarded if the city prevails in the action 2. In a civil enforcement action commenced by a designated person or a such person's attorney the defendant may apply for an amount of reasonable expenses, plus reasonable attorneys' fees, plus costs and the court may award such expenses, attorneys' fees and costs if it determines that such civil enforcement action was frivolous. All such expenses, attorneys' fees and costs shall be awarded directly against the person or person's attorney that commenced the action. k. The city shall not be liable for any expenses, attorneys' fees or costs that a person or a person's attorney incurs in submitting a proposed civil complaint or commencing or litigating a civil enforcement action pursuant to this section.
