All paint or similar surface-coating material on the interior of any day care facility in a structure erected prior to January 1, 1978, shall be presumed to be lead-based paint. b. The presumption established by this section may be rebutted by the operator or owner of the day care facility by submitting to the department a sworn written statement by the operator or owner of the day care facility supported by lead-based paint testing or sampling results, a sworn written statement by the person who performed the testing if performed by an employee or agent of the operator or owner of the day care facility, and such other proof as the department may require. Testing performed to rebut the presumption may only be performed by a person who has been certified as an inspector or risk assessor in accordance with subparts L and Q of part 745 of title 40 of the code of federal regulations or successor regulations. The determination as to whether such proof is adequate to rebut the presumption established by this section shall be made by the department. ",
