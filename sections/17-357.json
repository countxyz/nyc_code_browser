The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to a physician licensed under article one hundred thirty-one of the New York state education law. c. Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in this section, the commissioner may issue a seven-day temporary license to a person holding a license or similar certification or registration to engage in the practice of tattooing issued under the jurisdiction of another political subdivision, state or nation. Such temporary license will allow a person to apply tattoos within the city of New York under the direct supervision of a tattooist holding a license issued by the department pursuant to subdivision a of this section. Where an applicant for such a seven-day temporary license practices tattooing in a jurisdiction that does not license or otherwise register tattooists, the commissioner may issue such seven-day temporary license to such person upon the presentation of proof satisfactory to the commissioner that the applicant has received training equivalent to that necessary to satisfactorily pass the examination required in section 17-358. The fee for such temporary license shall be established in rules promulgated by the commissioner. ",
