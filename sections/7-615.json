No entry in any book or index in the register's office or the office of the clerk of the county of Richmond shall be erased so as to be illegible, but in case of any correction the same shall be made without destroying the original entry by drawing a line through such original entry, and in all such cases the date of such correction attested by the signature of such register or county clerk or his or her assistant shall be entered upon the same page on which such correction is made, on the margin opposite such correction. Such correction shall only be made upon the production to the register or county clerk of the original instrument, or, when it is impossible to produce the original instrument, the register or the county clerk, however, may make any correction of the records in his or her office where it is obvious or apparent that an error has been made in recording or indexing any instrument.
