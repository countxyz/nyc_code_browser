Whenever the city collector or any deputy collector shall cease to hold office, and within one year thereafter, it shall be the duty of the comptroller to examine the accounts of such city collector or deputy, and if found correct, to cause a certificate to that effect to be filed with the bond of such officer. Such certificate so filed shall be a full discharge and satisfaction of the conditions of such bond and the lien or liens thereby created. If at any time during the city collector's continuance in office the city collector or a deputy collector shall execute and file with the comptroller a new bond in the same form and penalty, and for the same period, and approved as provided in section 11-115 of the code, it shall be the duty of the comptroller forthwith to cause a certificate to that effect to be filed with the bond or bonds previously filed by such officer. Such certificate so filed shall be the full discharge and satisfaction of the condition of such prior bond or bonds and of the lien or liens thereby created. The comptroller may settle and adjust all claims in favor of or against the city, the surety or the principal in such bond, arising out of the execution of such bonds and in his or her discretion may release from the lien created by such bonds any piece or parcel of land affected thereby.
