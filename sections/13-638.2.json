(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, with respect to any installment of an unfunded accrued liability or an unfunded accrued liability adjustment, in the event that such retirement system has more than one responsible obligor, the actuary for that retirement system shall determine and shall allocate to each such responsible obligor its share of that installment, as determined to be appropriate by the actuary. Each responsible obligor's share of each such installment shall be either a charge or a credit with respect to such responsible obligor for the applicable fiscal year. (5) For each fiscal year, commencing with the two thousand eleven--two thousand twelve fiscal year, the actuary shall determine whether the sum of the charges and credits applicable to each responsible obligor for such fiscal year with respect to the applicable retirement system shall constitute a total charge or a total credit. Where such amount for such responsible obligor for such fiscal year with respect to such retirement system is a total charge, the responsible obligor shall pay an amount equal to such total charge to the retirement system in a timely manner, as required by paragraph six of this subdivision.

(2) In each fiscal year succeeding such June thirtieth, one of such recomputed installments shall be paid by or credited to, as the case may be, the responsible obligor or responsible obligors with respect to such retirement system in the same manner as the corresponding prior installments were paid or credited, until all such remaining installments are paid or credited in full; provided, however, that until all such installments are so disposed of, they shall be recomputed and paid or credited in recomputed form pursuant to this subdivision for each subsequent change in such valuation rate. m.
