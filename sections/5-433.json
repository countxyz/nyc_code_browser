In the case of the closing or discontinuance of the subsurface of a street, in whole or in part, specify if public utility facilities within the subsurface of such street shall be maintained in place or relocated within or without such subsurface so that the maintenance in place or proposed relocation of such facilities is consistent with the proposed use of the closed portion of such subsurface and the requirements of other facilities located therein. 2.
