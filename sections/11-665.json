Every foreign corporation (other than a moneyed corporation) subject to the provisions of this subchapter, except a corporation having authority to do business by virtue of section thirteen hundred five of the business corporation law, shall file in the department of state a certificate of designation in its corporate name, signed and acknowledged by its president or vice-president or its secretary or treasurer, under its corporate seal, designating the secretary of state as its agent upon whom process in any action provided for by this subchapter or subchapter five of this chapter may be served within this state, and setting forth an address to which the secretary of state shall mail a copy of any such process against the corporation which may be served upon the secretary of state. In case any such corporation shall have failed to file such certificate of designation, it shall be deemed to have designated the secretary of state as its agent upon whom such process against it may be served; and until a certificate of designation shall have been filed the corporation shall be deemed to have directed the secretary of state to mail copies of process served upon the secretary of state to the corporation at its last known office address within or without the state. When a certificate of designation has been filed by such corporation the secretary of state shall mail copies of process thereafter served upon the secretary of state to the address set forth in such certificate. Any such corporation, from time to time, may change the address to which the secretary of state is directed to mail copies of process, by filing a certificate to that effect executed, signed and acknowledged in like manner as a certificate of designation as herein provided. Service of process upon any such corporation or upon any corporation having authority to do business by virtue of section thirteen hundred five of the business corporation law, in any action commenced at any time pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter five or subchapter six of this chapter may be made by either: (1) personally delivering to and leaving with the secretary of state, a deputy secretary of state or with any person authorized by the secretary of state to receive such service duplicate copies thereof at the office of the department of state in the city of Albany, in which event the secretary of state shall forthwith send by registered mail, return receipt requested, one of such copies to the corporation at the address designated by it or at its last known office address within or without the state, or (2) personally delivering to and leaving with the secretary of state, a deputy secretary of state or with any person authorized by the secretary of state to receive such service, a copy thereof at the office of the department of state in the city of Albany and by delivering a copy hereof to, and leaving such copy with, the president, vice-president, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer, assistant treasurer, or cashier of such corporation, or the officer performing corresponding functions under another name, or a director or managing agent of such corporation, personally without the state. Proof of such personal service without the state shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which the action is pending within thirty days after such service, and such service shall be complete ten days after proof thereof is filed. 2. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules relative to the limitation of time of enforcing a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty prescribed by this subchapter or subchapter five of this chapter, provided, however, that as to real estate in the hands of persons who are owners thereof who would be purchasers in good faith but for such tax or penalty and as to the lien on real estate of mortgages held by persons who would be holders thereof in good faith but for such tax or penalty, all such taxes and penalties shall cease to be a lien on such real estate as against such purchasers or holders after the expiration of ten years from the date such taxes become due and payable. The limitations herein provided for shall not apply to any transfer from a corporation to a person or corporation with intent to avoid payment of any taxes, or where with like intent the transfer is made to a grantee corporation, or any subsequent grantee corporation controlled by such grantor or which has any community of interest with it, either through stock ownership or otherwise.
