Such presumptions shall prevail until the contrary is established and the burden of proving the contrary shall be on the taxpayer. The burden of proving that a lien or encumbrance existed on the real property or interest therein before the delivery of the deed and remained thereon thereafter and the burden of proving the amount of such lien or encumbrance at the time of the delivery of the deed shall be on the taxpayer.
