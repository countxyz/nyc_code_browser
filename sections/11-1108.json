If the claim is not filed within the three-year period, but is filed within the two-year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, he or she shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant. b.
