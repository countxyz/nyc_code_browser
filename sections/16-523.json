The commission shall by rule designate no more than two areas of the city in commercial areas within different boroughs to participate in a pilot project as special trade waste removal districts. In making any such designation, the commission shall consider: 1. the number and types of commercial establishments within the proposed district; 2. the amount and types of waste generated by commercial establishments within the proposed district; 3. existing service patterns within the proposed district; 4. the types and estimated amounts of recyclable materials generated by commercial establishments within the proposed district that are required to be recycled, reused or sold for reuse pursuant to section 16-306 of this code and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto; 5. the rates being charged by persons licensed pursuant to this subchapter to commercial establishments within the proposed district; and 6. the history of complaints from commercial establishments within the the district regarding overharging for the removal of trade waste or the inability to change providers of trade waste removal services. b. For each area designated as a special trade waste removal district by the commission pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the commission shall be authorized to enter into agreements with one or more specified licensee(s) permitting such licensee(s) to provide for the removal of trade waste within such district. The term of any such agreement, inclusive of any period by which the original term is extended at the option of the commission, shall not exceed two years. No such agreement(s) shall be entered into until a public hearing has been held with respect thereto after publication in the City Record at least thirty days in advance of such hearing and the commission has solicited as part of the record of such hearing whether there is support for the establishment of such special trade waste removal district from local business organizations or business improvement districts. c. The commission shall issue requests for proposals to conduct trade waste removal in a special trade waste removal district and, based upon the review and evaluation of responses thereto, may negotiate and enter into such agreement(s) pursuant to subdivision b of this section, as the commission, in its discretion, determines will best provide for the efficient and orderly removal of trade waste in such district. Such request for proposals shall solicit information regarding the qualifications of proposers, the nature and frequency of the trade waste removal services to be provided, the rate or rates to be charged to establishments for such services, the nature and extent of recycling services and waste audit services, if any, to be provided, and any other information relating to performance standards, customer service and security of performance the commission deems appropriate. The commission shall enter into one or more such agreement(s) if it finds, on the basis of the proposals, that such agreement(s) will likely result in improved customer service and lower rates. d. Any agreement(s) entered into pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall: (1) specify the area within which services will be provided under such agreement; (2) specify the frequency with which trade waste will be removed; (3) specify the maximum rate or rates to be charged to establishments in such area for the removal of trade waste generated by such establishments; (4) specify any recycling services and any waste audit programs to be provided to establishments within such area; (5) establish a procedure to determine the type and volume of waste removed from establishments in order to ensure adequate assessment of the charges for such removal, and prescribe any other appropriate requirements relating to performance standards, customer service, security of performance, or such other matters as the commission deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section; and (6) require that the licensee shall enter into a contract with an independent auditor approved or selected by the commission, and that such contract, the cost of which shall be paid by the licensee, shall provide: that the auditor shall investigate the activities of the licensee with respect to the licensee's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, other applicable federal, state and local laws and such other matters as the commission shall determine by rule; and that the auditor shall report the findings of such monitoring and investigation to the commission on a periodic basis, no less than four times a year. The commission shall be authorized to prescribe such reasonable terms and conditions in such contract as the commission deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. e. No service provided pursuant to an agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall be subcontracted, nor shall the right to provide service pursuant to such an agreement be assigned or otherwise delegated, whether upon an emergency or any other basis, unless the commission has provided specific written authorization therefor. f. The commission shall be authorized, upon due notice and hearing, to terminate an agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision b of this section based upon a determination that there has been a default in the performance of the terms and conditions of such agreement. In the event of termination, if the remaining licensees authorized to remove trade waste in the special trade waste district lack the capacity to adequately service the commercial establishments in such districts the commission may, as appropriate: (i) enter into an additional agreement with a licensee who responded to the request for proposals previously issued for the special trade waste removal district pursuant to subdivision c of this section; or (ii) issue a new request for proposals pursuant to subdivision c of such section. g. The provisions of this section and agreements concluded pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall not apply to: (1) the collection and disposal of recyclable materials as such term is defined in subdivision i of section 16-303 of this code where a commercial establishment wishes to contract separately for the sale of any such materials; (2) the collection and disposal of regulated medical waste pursuant to section 16-120.1 of this code; (3) the collection and disposal of waste containing asbestos pursuant to section 16-117.1 of this code; (4) the collection and disposal of demolition and construction debris or waste; (5) the collection and disposal of hazardous waste pursuant to section 27-0901 of the environmental conservation law, including material containing hazardous waste; (6) the removal and disposal of waste by the owner, lessee or person in control of a commercial establishment; (7) the removal and disposal of trade waste from a building with a floor area of two hundred thousand square feet or more, when the owner or managing agent of such building elects to arrange for the removal and disposal of all the trade waste from such building by a licensee other than a licensee with whom the commission has entered into agreement pursuant to subdivision b of this section; and (8) the removal and disposal of trade waste from a building located within the special trade waste removal district owned or controlled by an individual or an entity that owns or controls a building or buildings within the city of New York which, in the aggregate, occupy a floor area of one million square feet or more, where the contract for the collection, removal or disposal of trade waste for the building located within the special trade waste removal district is with a licensee who also provides trade waste removal services for other buildings within the city of New York that are owned or controlled by such individual or entity. For the purpose of this paragraph: an entity shall be defined as a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, net lessee, mortgagee or vendee in possession, a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver; and an individual shall be defined as a sole proprietor, the managing or general partner of one or more partnerships or the chief operating officer or executive officer of one or more corporations. An individual's aggregate ownership or controlling interest shall be computed by adding the square footage of all buildings within the city of New York owned by partnerships and corporations in which the individual serves as the managing or general partner of the partnerships and/or the chief operating officer or executive officer of the corporations, including those buildings where the managing or general partner is a corporation in which the individual is the chief operating officer or executive officer. h. Except for a licensee who has entered into an agreement with the commission pursuant to subdivision b of this section, a trade waste business required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter shall notify the commission of any agreement to provide a service described in subdivision g of this section within a special trade waste district. The commission may provide by rule for the visual identification of vehicles providing such services in a special trade waste district. i. Nothing in subdivision g of this section shall be construed to prohibit a commercial establishment in a special trade waste district from contracting for the services described in such subdivision with a licensee who has concluded an agreement pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
