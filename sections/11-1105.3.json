  "text": "ยง 11-1105.3 Lower Manhattan relocation employment assistance credit. (a) A taxpayer that has obtained the certifications required by chapter six-C of title twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter, provided, however, that a taxpayer that is a vendor of utility services shall not be allowed the credit against the tax imposed by this chapter unless it elects as provided in subdivision (d) of section 22-624 of the code to take the credit against the tax imposed by this chapter. The amount of the credit shall be the amount determined by multiplying three thousand dollars by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained by the taxpayer during the calendar year with respect to eligible premises to which the taxpayer has relocated; provided, however, that no credit shall be allowed for the relocation of any retail activity or hotel services. For purposes of this subdivision, the terms \"eligible aggregate employment shares\", \"eligible premises\", \"relocate\", \"retail activity\" and \"hotel services\" shall have the meanings ascribed by section 22-623 of the code. (b) The credit allowed under this section with respect to eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to eligible premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be allowed for the taxable period in which the relocation to eligible premises takes place and for succeeding taxable periods in the calendar year of the relocation and in any of the twelve succeeding calendar years during which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to eligible premises, provided that the credit allowed for the taxable periods in the twelfth succeeding calendar year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to eligible premises in the twelfth succeeding calendar year by the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year of relocation less the number of days the taxpayer maintained employment shares in eligible premises in the calendar year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of days in such twelfth succeeding calendar year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises. The credit allowable under this section shall be applied against the amount of tax otherwise required to be paid for the last taxable period of the calendar year as provided in subdivision a of section 11-1105 of this chapter, shall be deducted from the taxpayer's tax prior to the deduction of the credit provided in subdivision b of such section but after the credit provided for in section 11-1105.2 of this chapter, and shall be claimed on the tax return for the last taxable period of the calendar year. Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, if the amount of the credit allowable under this subdivision for any calendar year exceeds the tax imposed for such last taxable period in such calendar year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to the immediately succeeding taxable periods in the five immediately succeeding calendar years and, to the extent not previously allowable, shall be applied against the tax otherwise required to be paid for such periods. Such carryover credit shall be deducted from the taxpayer's tax prior to the deduction of the credit provided in subdivision b of section 11-1105 of this chapter but after the credit provided for in section 11-1105.2 of this chapter. With respect to the last taxable period in a calendar year, the credit for such calendar year shall be taken prior to any carryover credit. If in any period there are carryover credits available from more than one year, such credits shall be applied against the tax in the order in which they were earned with the oldest available credit being taken first. (c) The credits allowed under this section, against the tax imposed by this chapter for the calendar year of the relocation and for the four taxable years immediately succeeding the calendar year of such relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-1108 of this chapter. For such calendar years, such credits or portions thereof may not be carried over to any succeeding calendar year. ",
