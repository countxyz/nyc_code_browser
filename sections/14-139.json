Whenever any horses used in the department shall have become unfit for use therein, the commissioner, instead of causing such horses to be sold at auction, may transfer such horses to the custody of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, provided such society is willing to accept the custody thereof, to be disposed of in such manner as such society may deem best. If, however, any horse so received into the custody of such society and formerly used in the department shall thereafter be sold by such society, or any profit be derived from its use, the proceeds from such sale or use shall be paid over by such society to the commissioner, for the benefit of the police pension fund.
