(a) In addition to any other credit allowed by this part, a taxpayer that has obtained the certifications required by chapter six-B of title twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this part. The amount of the credit shall be the amount determined by multiplying five hundred dollars or, in the case of a taxpayer that has obtained pursuant to chapter six-B of such title twenty-two a certification of eligibility dated on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, one thousand dollars or, in the case of an eligible business that has obtained pursuant to chapter six-B of such title twenty-two a certification of eligibility dated on or after July first, two thousand, for a relocation to eligible premises located within a revitalization area defined in subdivision (n) of section 22-621 of the code, three thousand dollars, by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained by the taxpayer during the taxable year with respect to particular premises to which the taxpayer has relocated; provided, however, with respect to a relocation for which no application for a certificate of eligibility is submitted prior to July first, two thousand three to eligible premises that are not within a revitalization area, if the date of such relocation as determined pursuant to subdivision (j) of section 22-621 of the code is before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, the amount to be multiplied by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares shall be five hundred dollars, and with respect to a relocation for which no application for a certificate of eligibility is submitted prior to July first, two thousand three, to eligible premises that are within a revitalization area, if the date of such relocation as determined pursuant to subdivision (j) of such section is before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, the amount to be multiplied by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares shall be five hundred dollars, and if the date of such relocation as determined pursuant to subdivision (j) of such section is on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, and before July first, two thousand, one thousand dollars; provided, however, that no credit shall be allowed for the relocation of any retail activity or hotel services; and provided that in the case of an eligible business that has obtained pursuant to chapter six-B of such title twenty-two certifications of eligibility for more than one relocation, the portion of the total amount of eligible aggregate employment shares to be multiplied by the dollar amount specified in this subdivision for each such certification of a relocation shall be the number of total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares determined with respect to such relocation pursuant to subdivision (o) of section 22-621 of the code. For purposes of this section, the terms \"eligible aggregate employment shares,\" \"relocate,\" \"retail activity\" and \"hotel services\" shall have the meanings ascribed by section 22-621 of the code. (b) The credit allowed under this section with respect to eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to particular premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be allowed for the first taxable year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises and for any of the twelve succeeding taxable years during which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises; provided that the credit allowed for the twelfth succeeding taxable year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to such premises in the twelfth succeeding taxable year by the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is such number of days in the taxable year of relocation less the number of days the eligible business maintained employment shares in the eligible premises in the taxable year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of days in such twelfth succeeding taxable year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises. Except as provided in subdivision (d) of this section, if the amount of the credit allowable under this section for any taxable year exceeds the tax imposed for such year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to the five immediately succeeding taxable years and, to the extent not previously deductible, may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such years. (c) The credit allowable under this section shall be deducted after the credit allowed by section 11-643.8, but prior to the deduction of any other credit allowed by this part. (d) In the case of a taxpayer that has obtained a certification of eligibility pursuant to chapter six-B of title twenty-two of the code dated on or after July first, two thousand for a relocation to eligible premises located within the revitalization area defined in subdivision (n) of section 22-621 of the code, the credits allowed under this section, or in the case of a taxpayer that has relocated more than once, the portion of such credits attributed to such certification of eligibility pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year of such relocation and for the four taxable years immediately succeeding the taxable year of such relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter. For such taxable years, such credits or portions thereof may not be carried over to any succeeding taxable year; provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply to any relocation for which an application for a certification of eligibility was not submitted prior to July first, two thousand three, unless the date of such relocation is on or after July first, two thousand.
