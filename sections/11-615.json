  "text": "ยง 11-615 Exchange of property. Upon the sale or exchange of property the entire amount of the gain or loss, determined under section 11-614 of this part, shall be recognized, except as hereinafter provided in this section: 1. No gain or loss shall be recognized if common stock in a corporation is exchanged solely for common stock in the same corporation, or if preferred stock in a corporation is exchanged solely for preferred stock in the same corporation; 2. No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan or reorganization, exchanged solely for stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization; 3. No gain or loss shall be recognized if a taxpayer, a party to a reorganization, exchanges property, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization; and 4. No gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by a taxpayer solely in exchange for stock or securities in such corporation, and immediately after the exchange such taxpayer is in control of the corporation; but in the case of an exchange by a taxpayer and one or more other corporations or persons this subdivision shall apply only if the amount of the stock and securities received by each is substantially in proportion to its interest in the property prior to the exchange. 5. If property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in part, theft or seizure, or an exercise of the power of requisition or condemnation, or the threat of imminence thereof) is compulsorily or involuntarily converted into property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or into money which is forthwith in good faith, under regulations prescribed by the commissioner of finance, expended in the acquisition of other property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such other property, or in the establishment of a replacement fund, no gain or loss shall be recognized. If any part of the money is not so expended, the gain, if any, shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the money which is not so expended. 6. If there is distributed, in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, to a taxpayer shareholder in a corporation a party to the reorganization, stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization, without the surrender by such taxpayer shareholder of stock or securities in such a corporation, no gain to the distributee from the receipt of such stock or securities shall be recognized. 7. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subdivision one, two, or four of this section if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by such subdivision to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then the gain, if any, to the recipient shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property. 8. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subdivision three of this section if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by such subdivision to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then: (a) If the taxpayer receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the taxpayer shall be recognized from the exchange, but (b) If the taxpayer receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the taxpayer shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property so received, which is not so distributed. 9. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subdivision one, two, three, or four of this section if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by such subdivision to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, then no loss from the exchange shall be recognized. 10. As used in this section: The term \"reorganization\" means (a) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation, or substantially all the properties of another corporation), or (b) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or both are in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred, or (c) a recapitalization, or (d) a mere change in identity, form or place of organization, however effected; The term \"a party to a reorganization\" includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization and includes both corporations in the case of an acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation; and The term \"control\" means the ownership of at least eighty per centum of the voting stock and at least eighty per centum of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation. 11. No gain or loss shall be recognized upon the receipt by a taxpayer of property distributed in complete liquidation of a corporation. For the purposes of this subdivision a distribution shall be considered to be in complete liquidation only if: (a) the taxpayer receiving such property was, on the date of the adoption of the plan of liquidation, and has continued to be at all times until the receipt of the property, the owner of stock (in such corporation) possessing at least eighty per centum of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and the owner of at least eighty per centum of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock (except non-voting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends), and was at no time on or after the date of the adoption of the plan of liquidation and until the receipt of the property the owner of a greater percentage of any class of stock than the percentage of such class owned at the time of the receipt of the property; and either: (b) the distribution is by such corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock, and the transfer of all the property occurs within the base year; in such case the adoption by the shareholders of the resolution under which is authorized the distribution of all the assets of the corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock, shall be considered an adoption of a plan of liquidation, even though no time for the completion of the transfer of the property is specified on such resolution; or (c) such distribution is one of a series of distributions by such corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock in accordance with a plan of liquidation under which the transfer of all the property under the liquidation is to be completed within three years from the close of the year during which is made the first of the series of distributions under the plan, except that if such transfer is not completed within such period, or if the taxpayer does not continue qualified under paragraph (a) until the completion of such transfer, no distribution under the plan shall be considered a distribution in complete liquidation. If such transfer of all the property does not occur within the year, the commissioner of finance may require of the taxpayer such bond, or waiver of the statute of limitations on assessment and collection, or both, as the commissioner may deem necessary to insure, if the transfer of the property is not completed within such three year period, or if the taxpayer does not continue qualified under paragraph (a) until the completion of such transfer, the assessment and collection of all taxes then imposed under this part for such year or subsequent years, to the extent attributable to property so received. A distribution otherwise constituing a distribution in complete liquidation within the meaning of this paragraph shall not be considered as not constituting such a distribution merely because it does not constitute a distribution or liquidation within the meaning of the corporate law under which the distribution is made; and for the purposes of this paragraph a transfer of property of such corporation to the taxpayer shall not be considered as not constituting a distribution (or one of a series of distributions) in complete cancellation or redemption of all the stock of such corporation, merely because the carrying out of the plan involves: (1) the transfer under the plan to the taxpayer by such corporation of property, not attributable to shares owned by the taxpayer, upon an exchange described in subdivision three of this section, and (2) the complete cancellation or redemption under the plan, as a result of exchanges described in subdivision two of this section, of the shares not owned by the taxpayers.
