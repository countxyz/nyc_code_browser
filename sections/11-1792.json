  "text": "ยง 11-1792 Collection, levy and liens. (a) Collection procedures. The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected by the tax commission, and it may establish the mode or time for the collection of any amount due it under this chapter if not otherwise specified. The tax commission shall, upon request, give a receipt for any sum collected under this chapter. The tax commission may authorize banks or trust companies which are depositaries or financial agents of the state to receive and give a receipt for any tax imposed under this chapter in such manner, at such times, and under such conditions as the tax commission may prescribe; and the tax commission shall prescribe the manner, times and conditions under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the tax commission. (b) Notice and demand for tax. The tax commission shall as soon as practicable give notice to each person liable for any amount of tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest, which has been assessed but remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. Such notice shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person or shall be sent by mail to such person's last known address. Except where the tax commission determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the last date (including any date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date. (c) Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person liable under this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest neglects or refuses to pay the same within twenty-one calendar days after notice and demand therefor is given to such person under subdivision (b) of this section (ten business days if the amount for which such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds one hundred thousand dollars), the commissioner of taxation and finance may within six years after the date of such assessment issue a warrant under such commissioner's official seal directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, or to any officer or employee of the department of taxation and finance, commanding him or her to levy upon and sell such person's real and personal property for the payment of the amount assessed, with the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to such commissioner and pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of the warrant. If such commissioner finds that the collection of the tax or other amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by such commissioner and upon failure or refusal to pay such tax or other amount such commissioner may issue a warrant without regard to the twenty-one day period (or ten-day period if applicable) provided in this subdivision. (d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this section shall within five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of the appropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the judgment docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the tax or other amounts for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a lien upon the title to and interest in real, personal and other property of the taxpayer. Such lien shall not apply to personal property unless such warrant is filed in the department of state. (e) Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the tax commission shall, in the right of the city, be deemed to have obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts. (f) Execution. The sheriff or officer or employee shall thereupon proceed upon the warrant in all respects, with like effect, and in the same manner prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and a sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees for his or her services in executing the warrant, to be collected in the same manner. An officer or employee of the department of taxation and finance may proceed in any county or counties of this state and shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the warrant. (g) Taxpayer not a resident. Where a notice and demand under subdivision (b) of this section shall have been given to a taxpayer who is not then a resident, and it appears to the tax commission that it is not practicable to find in this state property of the taxpayer sufficient to pay the entire balance of tax or other amount owing by such taxpayer who is not then a resident, the tax commission may, in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section, issue a warrant directed to an officer or employee of the department of taxation and finance, a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address, subject to the rules for mailing provided in subdivision (a) of section 11-1781. Such warrant shall command the officer or employee to proceed in Albany county, and he or she shall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file the warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon the tax commission may authorize the institution of any action or proceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any procedure that a civil judgment of the supreme court of the state of New York could be collected or enforced. The tax commission may also, in its discretion, designate agents or retain counsel for the purpose of collecting, outside the state of New York, any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter against taxpayers who are not residents of this state, may fix the compensation of such agents and counsel to be paid out of money appropriated or otherwise lawfully available for payment thereof, and may require of them bonds or other security for the faithful performance of their duties, in such form and in such amount as the tax commission shall deem proper and sufficient. (h) Action by state for recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by the attorney general at the instance of the tax commission in the name of the city or both to recover the amount of any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter within six years prior to the date the action is commenced. (i) Release of lien. The tax commission, if it finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as it may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to this section, and such release may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed.
