The agency submitting the departmental estimate for a capital project shall furnish to the court such surveys, diagrams, maps and plans as the court shall require, to enable the court to hear and determine the claims of the owners of the real property affected by the proceeding. Such surveys, diagrams, maps and plans shall distinctly indicate by separate numbers, the names of the claimants to, or of the owners of the respective parcels of real property to be taken in such proceedings, so far as the same are known, and shall also specify in figures with sufficient accuracy the dimensions and bounds of each of such tracts to be taken. The court may require any agency of the city, if the corporation counsel shall approve, to furnish such other surveys, diagrams, maps and plans and such other information as shall aid and assist the court in the trial or determination of the proceeding. b. It shall be lawful for the duly authorized agents of the agency furnishing such surveys, diagrams, maps and plans, and all persons acting under their or its authority and by their or its direction, to enter in the daytime into and upon such real property which it shall be necessary so to enter, for the purpose of making such surveys, diagrams and maps or plans as such agency shall deem necessary.
