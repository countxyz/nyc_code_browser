The public employee organization which is authorized to represent a transit police member for purposes of collective bargaining with the New York city transit authority. (2) \"Panel of medical experts\". Those physicians whose names are set forth in a list of medical experts prepared annually by the commissioner of health and filed in his or her office and with the executive director of the retirement system on or before July first. The experts so designated shall be physicians having qualifications as specialists in such fields of medicine as such commissioner deems an essential background (i) for ascertaining, in cases where an application for disability retirement is filed by or with respect to a transit police member, whether such member is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of city-service, and (ii) for rendering of reports or certifications as to diagnosis and issues of causal relationship with respect to such applications. Each of such physicians shall have had, prior to his or her designation, at least ten years of practice in the field with respect to which he or she is designated. The names of such physicians shall be separately grouped on such list, according to the fields of medicine in which they are expert, and the names in each group shall be consecutively numbered. (3) \"Party entitled to review\". Either of the following: (i) the bargaining representative of such member; or (ii) the New York city transit authority. b. (1) In any case where an application for retirement of a transit police member for disability has been filed pursuant to section 13-157 of this chapter, the secretary of the retirement system, promptly after the retirement board acts on the report or certification of the medical board with respect to such application, shall give notice of such action by the board constituting such head to such member and to the New York city transit authority. Within fifteen days after such notification, any party entitled to review may file with the secretary a written request that a special medical committee, as provided for in this section, shall review the conclusions and recommendations of the medical board set forth in its report or certification. (2) (i) Any request for review filed by a bargaining representative with respect to such application for disability retirement shall be void and of no effect unless such request includes a waiver, as hereinafter provided, duly executed and acknowledged by the transit police member or by a person acting in his or her behalf as hereinafter provided. Such waiver may be executed by a person acting in behalf of such member in any case where, at the time of the execution of such waiver by such person, the circumstances are such that if such application for disability retirement had not been previously filed by or with respect to such member, such person would at such time of execution be authorized under the provisions of section 13-157 of this chapter to file, as a person acting in behalf of such member, an application for disability retirement of such member. (ii) Such waiver shall provide that the execution thereof by such member or by a person acting in his or her behalf as hereinabove authorized shall constitute an agreement by such member that his or her application for disability retirement under section 13-157 of this chapter shall be disposed of by action of the board constituting the head of the retirement system pursuant to the provisions of this section, that such action shall be final and conclusive, and that he or she waives any and all rights which he or she might otherwise have to seek or obtain any other disposition of such application for disability retirement by court or administrative proceedings or otherwise. A waiver so executed and filed shall be effective and binding upon such member, in accordance with its terms. c. Promptly after the filing of a request for review to be made by a special medical committee, the secretary shall transmit a copy of such request and of the report or certification of the medical board to the commissioner of health. d. The commissioner, upon receipt of such report or certification and request, shall promptly designate three of the physicians on the panel of medical experts as a special medical committee for the purpose of reviewing the recommendations and conclusions of the medical board in such case. Such physicians shall be selected by him or her from the panel group possessing the specialist qualifications deemed essential by him or her for such review. All selections of physicians pursuant to this subdivision d shall be made in order of numerical standing in the group from which selection is to be made, and on the basis of continuous rotation within the group. e.

(2) Such special medical committee shall, within thirty days after such notification to the physicians constituting such committee is completed, perform, with respect to the application for retirement of such member for disability, the same functions of medical examination or otherwise as are prescribed by applicable provisions of law for performance by the medical board with respect to such application, and shall within such period adopt by majority vote and file with the executive director a report or certification, as the case may be, stating the conclusions and recommendations of such committee concerning the matters required to be reported on or certified by the medical board, pursuant to such applicable provisions of law, with respect to such application. f. The conclusions and recommendations of the special medical committee shall supersede those of the medical board. g. (1) Each physician who serves as a member of a special medical committee shall receive a fee for such service, to be determined by the comptroller of the city. (2) With respect to each case in which a special medical committee acts, one-half of the fees of the members of such committee shall be paid by the city. The other half of such fees shall be paid by the bargaining representative of the transit police member concerned in such case. h. (1) Within forty-five days after the filing of the report or certification of the special medical committee, the board constituting the head of the retirement system shall act on such report or certification as hereinafter provided in this subdivision h. (2) If the application is for ordinary disability retirement of the member pursuant to section 13-157 of this chapter, and if the medical examination by the special medical committee shows that such member is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of duty as a uniformed police officer patrolling the transit system and ought to be retired, such committee shall so report and such board constituting such head shall retire such member for ordinary disability as of the date on which such board constituting such head acted on the report of the medical board with respect to such application, or as of the date ninety days after the filing of such application for such retirement, whichever is earlier. (3) If the application is for accident disability retirement of the member pursuant to section 13-157 of this chapter and if the medical examination and investigation of the special medical committee shows that such member is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of city-service as a natural and proximate result of an accidental injury received in such city-service while a member, and that such disability was not the result of wilful negligence on the part of such member and that such member should be retired, the special medical committee shall so certify to such board constituting such head stating the time, place and conditions of such city-service performed by such member resulting in such disability, and such board constituting such head shall retire such member for accident disability as of the date on which such board acted on the report of the medical board with respect to such application. i. In any case where a request for review by a special medical committee is filed pursuant to the provisions of this section, the provisions of section 13-157 of this chapter shall be superseded by the provisions of this section to the extent that the provisions of this section are inconsistent therewith. j. (1) In any case where the provisions of this section require the executive director to give notice to a transit police member, the secretary may give such notice by delivery to such member personally or by mailing same to his or her last known address, as shown by the records of the transit police department of the New York city transit authority. (2) In any case where the provisions of this section require the giving of notice or the transmission of papers to any other person, such notice may be given or transmission effected by delivery to such person, by delivery at his or her office to any of his or her employees, or by mailing to the office address of such person.
