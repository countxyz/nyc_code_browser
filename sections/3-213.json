(a) (1) Every lobbyist shall annually file with the city clerk, on forms prescribed by the city clerk, a statement of registration for each calendar year, provided, however, that the filing of such statement of registration shall not be required of any lobbyist who in any year does not expend, incur or receive an amount in excess of two thousand dollars of reportable compensation and expenses, as provided in paragraph five of subdivision (b) of section 3-216 of this subchapter, for the purposes of lobbying. (2) Such filing shall be completed on or before January first by those persons who have been retained, employed or designated as lobbyists on or before December fifteenth of the previous calendar year who reasonably anticipate that in the coming year they will expend, incur or receive combined reportable compensation and expenses in an amount in excess of two thousand dollars. For those lobbyists retained, employed or designated after December fifteenth, and for those lobbyists who, subsequent to their retainer, employment or designation, reasonably anticipate combined reportable compensation and expenses in excess of such amount, such filing must be completed within fifteen days thereafter, but in no event later than ten days after the actual incurring or receiving of such reportable compensation and expenses. (b) Such statements of registration shall be kept in electronic form in the office of the city clerk and shall be available for public inspection. (c) Such statement of registration shall contain: (1) the name, home and business addresses and business telephone number of the lobbyist and the name and home and business addresses of the spouse or domestic partner of the lobbyist, and if the lobbyist is an organization the name, home and business addresses and business telephone number of any officer or employee of such lobbyist who engages in any lobbying activities or who is employed in an organization's division that engages in lobbying activities of the organization and the name and home and business addresses of the spouse or domestic partner of such officers or employees, provided that, notwithstanding any provision of this subchapter to the contrary, the home address of the lobbyist, including, if the lobbyist is an organization, the home address of any officer or employee of such lobbyist who engages in any lobbying activities or who is employed in an organization's division that engages in lobbying activities of the organization, and the names and home and business addresses of spouses and domestic partners of such lobbyists, officers and employees, whether contained in an original or amended statement of registration, shall not be made available to the public, but may be accessed by the campaign finance board for the sole purpose of determining whether a campaign contribution is matchable pursuant to section 3-702 of the New York City campaign finance act; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of law, in making information on campaign contributions publicly available, the campaign finance board shall not disclose that any specific contributor is the spouse, domestic partner or unemancipated child of such a lobbyist, officer or employee; (2) the name, address and telephone number of the client by whom or on whose behalf the lobbyist is retained, employed or designated; (3) if such lobbyist is retained or employed pursuant to a written agreement of retainer or employment, a copy of such shall also be attached and if such retainer or employment is oral, a statement of the substance thereof; (4) a written authorization from the client by whom the lobbyist is authorized to lobby, unless such lobbyist has filed a written agreement of retainer or employment pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision; (5) a description of the subject or subjects on which the lobbyist is lobbying or expects to lobby, including information sufficient to identify the local law or resolution, procurement, real property, rule, rate making proceeding, determination of a board or commission, or other matter on which the lobbyist is lobbying or expects to lobby; (6) the name of the person or agency before which the lobbyist is lobbying or expects to lobby; (7) if the lobbyist has a financial interest in the client, direct or indirect, information as to the extent of such interest and the date on which it was acquired; and (d) (1) Whenever there is a change in the information filed by the lobbyist in the original statement of registration, an amended statement shall be submitted to the city clerk on forms prescribed by the city clerk within ten days after such change occurs, except as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision; however, this shall not require the lobbyist to amend the entire registration form. (2) Whenever a contribution, as defined in subdivision eight of section 3-702 of the New York City campaign finance act, is made by the unemancipated child of a lobbyist or by the unemancipated child of the spouse or domestic partner of a lobbyist or, if the lobbyist is an organization, by the unemancipated child of any officer or employee of such lobbyist who engages in lobbying activities or who is employed in an organization's division that engages in lobbying activities of the organization or by the unemancipated child of the spouse or domestic partner of any such officer or employee, in the calendar year for which a statement of registration is filed, the lobbyist shall file an amended statement of registration within forty-eight hours of the making of such contribution. Such amended statement of registration shall contain the name and the home address of such unemancipated child and the home and business addresses of the unemancipated child's parent, if such parent's home and business addresses were reported pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section. Such amendment shall not require the lobbyist to amend the entire registration form. If such contribution was made in the calendar year for which a statement of registration is filed, but before the filing of such statement of registration, then the original statement of registration shall contain the name and the home address of such unemancipated child and the home and business addresses of the unemancipated child's parent, if such parent's home and business addresses were reported pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision (c) of this section. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the names and addresses of unemancipated children shall not be made available to the public, but may be accessed by the campaign finance board for the sole purpose of determining whether a campaign contribution is matchable pursuant to such section 3-702; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of law, in making information on campaign contributions publicly available, the campaign finance board shall not disclose that any specific contributor is the spouse, domestic partner or unemancipated child of such a lobbyist, officer or employee. For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"unemancipated child\" shall mean any son, daughter, stepson or stepdaughter who is under age eighteen, unmarried and living in the household of such lobbyist or spouse or domestic partner of such lobbyist or, if such lobbyist is an organization, living in the household of such officer or employee or spouse or domestic partner of such officer or employee. (e) Each statement of registration filed annually by each lobbyist shall be accompanied by a registration fee of one hundred fifty dollars. An additional fee may be imposed not to exceed fifty dollars for each client in excess of one identified on such statement. (f) In the event of the retention, employment or designation of an organization wherein more than one member of the organization will be engaging in lobbying activities on behalf of a client, one statement of registration shall be filed by the organization with a listing of all such persons.
