Whenever a woman is arrested and taken to a police station, it shall be the duty of the officer in command of the station to cause a female staff member assigned to this detail to be summoned forthwith, and whenever a woman is arrested in any precinct in which no such female staff member is assigned, she shall be taken directly to the station house designated to receive the women prisoners of the precinct in which the arrest is made. Such separate confinement, or any such removal of any woman, shall not operate to take from any court any jurisdiction which it would have had. The term \"woman\" as used in this section and section 14-131 of this title shall not include any female either actually or apparently under the age of sixteen years whose care is assumed by any incorporated society for the prevention of cruelty to children; but every such female detainee under the age of sixteen shall be taken directly to a station house designated to receive women prisoners and shall be at once transferred therefrom by the officer in charge, to the custody of such society.
