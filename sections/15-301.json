The council finds that within the past several years there have been increasing incidences of arson which have endangered life and property in some areas of the city; that deaths and serious injuries to many persons have resulted therefrom and much property has been destroyed; that extensive areas of burned-out buildings now blight parts of the city; that arson hastens the deterioration of communities; that residents are compelled to flee to other areas; that businesses and commercial enterprises are compelled to close, many never to open again; that fire insurance premiums increase; and that drastic steps are necessary to prevent the spread of this problem to other areas of the city. The council hereby declares that it is imperative that a permanent arson strike force be established that will foster greater cooperation between the various city agencies in the battle to control the arson problem that confronts the city.
