If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed in whichever of the named subchapters is applicable for payment, interest on such amount at the underpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-687 of this subchapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid, whether or not any extension of time for payment was granted. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar. 2. Exception as to estimated tax. This section shall not apply to any failure to pay estimated tax under subchapter two or subchapter three of this chapter. 3. Exception for mathematical error. No interest shall be imposed on any underpayment of tax due solely to mathematical error if the taxpayer files a return within the time prescribed in whichever of the named subchapters is applicable (including any extension of time) and pays the amount of underpayment within three months after the due date of such return, as it may be extended. 4. Suspension of interest on deficiencies. If a waiver of restrictions on assessment of a deficiency has been filed by the taxpayer, and if notice and demand by the commissioner of finance for payment of such deficiency is not made within thirty days after the filing of such waiver, interest shall not be imposed on such deficiency for the period beginning immediately after such thirtieth day and ending with the date of notice and demand. 5. Tax reduced by carry back. If the amount of tax under subchapter two for any taxable year is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating loss or a capital loss, such reduction in tax shall not affect the computation of interest under this section for the period ending with the filing date for the taxable year in which the net operating loss or capital loss arises. Such filing date shall be determined without regard to extensions of time to file. 6. Interest treated as tax. Interest under this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the taxes under the named subchapters. Any reference in this subchapter to the tax imposed by the named subchapters, or any of them, shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this section on such tax. 7. Interest on penalties or addition to tax. Interest shall be imposed under subdivision one in respect to any assessable penalty or addition to tax only if such assessable penalty or addition to tax is not paid within ten days from the date of the notice and demand therefor under subdivision two of section 11-683 of this subchapter in such case interest shall be imposed only for the period from such date of the notice and demand to the date of payment. 8. Payment within ten days after notice and demand. If notice and demand is made for payment of any amount under subdivision two of section 11-683 of this subchapter, and if such amount is paid within ten days after the date of such notice and demand, interest under this section on the amount so paid shall not be imposed for the period after the date of such notice and demand. 9. Limitation on assessment and collection. Interest prescribed under this section may be assessed and collected at any time during the period within which the tax or other amount to which such interest relates may be assessed and collected respectively. 10. Interest on erroneous refund. Any portion of tax or other amount which has been erroneously refunded, and which is recoverable by the commissioner of finance, shall bear interest at the underpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-687 of this subchapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum from the date of the payment of the refund, but only if it appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or a misrepresentation of a material fact. 11. Satisfaction by credits. If any portion of a tax is satisfied by credit of an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed under this section on the portion of the tax so satisfied for any period during which, if the credit had not been made, interest would have been allowable with respect to such overpayment.
