Whenever any person has engaged in any acts or practices which constitute a violation of any provision of this subchapter or of any rule promulgated thereunder, the city may make application to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order enjoining such acts or practices and for an order granting a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order or other order enjoining such acts or practices. e. For purposes of this section, \"arm's length transaction\" means a sale of a fee or all undivided interests in real property, or lease of any part thereof, or a sale of a business, in good faith and for valuable consideration, that reflects the fair market value of such real property or lease, or business, in the open market, between two informed and willing parties, where neither is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction, unaffected by any unusual conditions indicating a reasonable possibility that the sale or lease was made for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. The following sales or leases shall be presumed not to be arm's length transactions unless adequate documentation is provided demonstrating that the sale or lease was not conducted, in whole or in part, for the purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises: (1) a sale between relatives; or (2) a sale between related companies or partners in a business; or (3) a sale or lease affected by other facts or circumstances that would indicate that the sale or lease is entered into for the primary purpose of permitting the original licensee to avoid the effect of violations on the premises. f. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a of this section, the mandatory revocation of a license for a second offense shall be waived if, upon the submission of satisfactory proof, the commissioner determines that the person or persons who committed the violations which are the basis for the mandatory revocation acted against the licensee's will in committing such violations, the licensee utilized extensive precautionary measures to prevent violations of the provisions of sections 17-704, 17-705 and 17-706 of this code, and the licensee has terminated any financial or employment relationship with each person who committed the violations which are the basis of the mandatory revocation of its license or has taken other significant disciplinary action against such persons. The commissioner shall not determine that a licensee utilized extensive precautionary measures to prevent violations of the provisions of sections 17-704, 17-705 and 17-706 of this code unless the licensee submits satisfactory proof demonstrating that the licensee had, prior to the second violation which is the basis for the mandatory revocation of its license, done the following: (1) implemented a clear policy requiring all persons working in the place of business to strictly comply with the provisions of sections 17-704, 17-705 and 17-706 of this code and permitting persons working in the place of business to complete a tobacco product sales transaction only after establishing the age of a prospective purchaser of tobacco products through identification that has been verified for authenticity or through photographic identification as required by section 17-706 of this code; and (2) trained all persons working in the place of business to comply with any such policy before they are allowed to sell tobacco products to the public; and (3) monitored the performance of persons working in the place of business to ensure that they adhere to such policy, or, in accordance with rules promulgated by the commissioner, conducted periodic retraining of persons working in the place of business.
