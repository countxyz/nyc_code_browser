To any such member who, at any time, while in the actual performance of duty, and without fault or misconduct on the part of such member, has become permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be unfit to perform the duties required of such member, provided that such unfitness for duty has been certified to by a majority of the medical examiners of such department, the sum of fifty dollars per month. 2.
