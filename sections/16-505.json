It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a business for the purpose of the collection of trade waste from the premises of a commercial establishment required to provide for the removal of such waste pursuant to the provisions of section 16-116 of this code, or the removal or disposal of trade waste from such premises, or to engage in, conduct or cause the operation of such a business, without having first obtained a license therefor from the commission pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, a business solely engaged in the removal of waste materials resulting from building demolition, construction, alteration or excavation shall be exempt from the licensing provisions of this subdivision where, except in regard to the principals of a business solely in either or both of the class seven or the class three category of licensees as defined in rules previously promulgated by the commissioner of consumer affairs pursuant to subchapter eighteen of chapter two of title twenty of this code, no principal of such applicant is a principal of a business or a former business required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter or such former subchapter eighteen. Grant of such exemption shall be made by the commission upon its review of an exemption application, which shall be in the form and contain the information prescribed by rule of the commission and shall be accompanied by a statement by the applicant describing the nature of the applicant's business and listing all principals of such business. b. It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, collect or dispose of trade waste that is generated in the course of operation of such person's business, or to operate as a trade waste broker, without first having registered with the commission. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to require registration with the commission of (i) a commercial establishment required to provide for the removal of waste pursuant to section 16-116 of this code in order for such establishment to remove recyclable materials generated in the course of its own business to a location owned or leased by such establishment for the purpose of collecting or storing such materials for sale or further distribution; (ii) an owner or managing agent of a building in order to remove recyclable materials generated by commercial tenants within such building to a central location within such building for the purpose of collecting or storing such materials for sale or further distribution; or (iii) an owner of an establishment required to provide for the removal of waste pursuant to section 16-116 of this code in order to transport beverage containers, as such term is defined in section 27-1003 of the environmental conservation law, or any other recyclable material generated in the course of operation of its own business, to a redemption center, as such term is defined in section 27-1003 of such law, or to any other place where payment will be received by the commercial establishment for such materials. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, a business granted an exemption from the requirement for a license pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be thereupon issued a registration pursuant to this subdivision. c. A license or registration issued pursuant to this chapter or any rule promulgated hereunder shall not be transferred or assigned to any person or used by any person other than the licensee or registrant to whom it was issued.
