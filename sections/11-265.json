The department of finance may deny, reduce, suspend, revoke or terminate any exemption from or abatement or deferral of tax payments pursuant to this part whenever: (1) a recipient fails to comply with the requirements of this part or the rules and regulations promulgated by the department of finance pursuant thereto; or (2) an application, certificate, report or other document delivered by an applicant or recipient hereunder contains a false or misleading statement as to a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading, and may declare any applicant or recipient who makes such false or misleading statement or omission to be ineligible for future exemption, abatement or deferral pursuant to this part for the same or other property. b. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a recipient shall be personally liable for any taxes owed pursuant to this part whenever such recipient fails to comply with such law and rules or makes such false or misleading statement or omission, and the department of finance determines that such act was due to the recipient's willful neglect, or that under the circumstances such act constituted a fraud on the department of finance or a buyer or prospective buyer of the property. The remedy provided herein for an action in personam shall be in addition to any other remedy or procedure for the enforcement of collection of deliquent taxes provided by any general, special or local law. Any lease provision which obligates a tenant to pay taxes which become due because of willful neglect or fraud by the recipient, or otherwise relieve or indemnify the recipient from any personal liability arising hereunder, shall be void as against public policy except where the imposition of such taxes or liability is occasioned by actions of the tenant in violation of the lease.
