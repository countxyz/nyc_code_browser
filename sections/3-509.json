Upon receiving such a notice, the borough president shall cause one of the city surveyors, or an engineer in the borough president's office to take the necessary measures to raise or lower such monument or bolt to the proper grade of the street, and, when necessary, to cause such alteration to be noted on records to be kept in the borough president's office for that purpose. Whenever a borough president shall ascertain that any monument or bolt has been removed, without such notice, he or she shall forthwith cause the same to be placed in its proper position, and shall note the same on the records in the manner hereinbefore stated. The expenses attending such replacement shall be paid by the comptroller, on the certificate of the borough president causing the work to be done. ",
