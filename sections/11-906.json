(a) The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action by the commissioner of finance to levy, assess, determine or enforce the collection of tax, interest or penalty imposed by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent report, no assessment of additional tax, interest or penalty shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a report, provided, however, that where no report has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time. The commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, with interest at the overpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (g) of section 11-905 of this chapter or, if no rate is set, at the rate of six percent per annum computed from the date of overpayment to a date (to be determined by the commissioner of finance) preceding the date of a refund check by not more than thirty days, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within six months from the payment thereof. Notice of any determination of the commissioner of finance with respect to an assessment of tax, interest or penalty or with respect to a claim for refund or any other notice, demand or request shall be given by mailing the same to the insurer to the address of its New York city office last filed with the commissioner of finance or, if there is no such office, to the address of its main office last filed with the commissioner of finance or, in the absence of any filed address, to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of any notice, demand or request by the commissioner of finance shall be presumptive evidence of its receipt by the insurer and any period of time to be determined with reference to the giving of such notice, demand or request shall commence to run from the date of such mailing. The determination of the commissioner of finance shall finally and irrevocably fix the amount of any tax, interest or penalty due or to be refunded unless the taxpayer, within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination, or if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the taxpayer and to the commissioner of finance with reference to the amount of the tax, interest or penalty assessed or to be refunded. The decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason, by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if such proceeding is commenced by the person against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. Such proceeding shall not be commenced by the taxpayer unless: (1) the amount of any tax assessed and sought to be reviewed with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the decision confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue against the taxpayer in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (2) in the case of a review of a decision assessing any taxes, penalties and interest, at the option of the taxpayer, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover all of the taxes, penalties and interest assessed by such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against the taxpayer in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the commencement of the proceeding. No determination or proposed determination of tax, interest or penalty due or to be refunded shall be reviewed or enjoined in any manner except as set forth herein. (b) In cases where the taxpayer has applied for a refund and has commenced a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal adverse to such taxpayer on its application for a refund, the commissioner of finance shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city. (c) In computing the amount of interest to be paid under this section, such interest shall be compounded daily. ",
