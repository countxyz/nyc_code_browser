The officers charged with the custody of such reports and returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the city in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter or in any other action or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due under this chapter to which the city is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the reports, returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in any of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said reports, returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or to the taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return or report filed in connection with his or her tax or to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and the items thereof, or the inspection by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city of the report or return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding under this chapter has been recommended by the commissioner of finance or the corporation counsel or has been instituted, or the inspection of the reports or returns required under this chapter by the duly designated officers or employees of the city for purposes of an audit under this chapter or an audit authorized by the enacting of this chapter.
