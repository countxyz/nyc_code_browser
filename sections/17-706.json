Any person operating a place of business wherein tobacco products are sold or offered for sale must be licensed as required by section 17-703 of this code and is prohibited from selling such products to individuals under eighteen years of age, and shall post in a conspicuous place a sign upon which there shall be imprinted the following statement, \"SALE OF CIGARETTES, CIGARS, CHEWING TOBACCO, POWDERED TOBACCO, OR OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS, ROLLING PAPER OR PIPES, TO PERSONS UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.\" Such sign shall be printed on a white card in red letters at least one-half inch in height.

Such identification need not be required of any individual who reasonably appears to be at least twenty-five years of age, provided, however, that such appearance shall not constitute a defense in any proceeding alleging the sale of a tobacco product to an individual under eighteen years of age.
