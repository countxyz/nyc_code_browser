Notwithstanding any provision of the charter, checks drawn upon any bank or trust company for payment of payrolls or disbursements for relief, required to be signed by the head of an agency or his or her authorized designee, may be signed by the facsimile signature or signatures of the person or persons authorized to sign such checks, if the head of such agency so authorizes by an instrument in writing signed by the head of such agency and filed with the comptroller; and, in such event, any bank or trust company shall, acting in good faith and without notice of any defect or invalidity, be authorized to pay and be protected in paying any checks bearing or purporting to bear the facsimile signature or signatures of the person or persons duly authorized to sign such checks, regardless of the person by whom or the means by which the actual or purported facsimile signature or signatures thereon may have been affixed thereto, if such facsimile signature or signatures closely resemble the facsimile specimens from time to time filed with such banks or trust companies by the head of the agency in question; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall release such bank or trust company from any liability arising from any cause or fact other than the fact that such facsimile signature is not a genuine facsimile signature affixed with appropriate authority.
