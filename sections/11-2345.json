(a) Each wireless communications service customer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to the city of New York for the surcharge until it has been paid to the city except that payment to a wireless communications service supplier is sufficient to relieve the customer from further liability for such surcharge. (b) No wireless communications service supplier shall have a legal obligation to enforce the collection of any surcharge imposed under the provisions of this chapter, provided, however, that whenever the wireless communications service supplier remits the funds collected to the city of New York, it shall also provide the city with the name and address of any customer refusing or failing to pay the surcharge and shall state the amount of such surcharge remaining unpaid.
