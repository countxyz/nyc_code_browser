Such supplemental retirement allowance for those closed pension fund disability retirees and closed pension fund other-than-disability retirees who retired prior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight shall include an amount computed by multiplying the base amount by a percentage determined on the basis of the consumer price index (all items--United States city average) published by the United States bureau of labor statistics. c. (1) The percentage referred to in subdivision b of this section shall be determined as the ratio of two indexes, in the manner prescribed in this subdivision c.
