If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted for payment), interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date of payment. In computing the amount of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded daily. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar. (b) * (1) Failure to file return. (A) In case of failure to file a return under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as tax on such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on such return. (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 60, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower amount. (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown on return. In case of failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not so shown (including a determination made pursuant to section 11-1106 of this chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice and demand therefor, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such month. * (4) Limitations on additions. (A) With respect to any return, the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to which an addition applies under both paragraphs one and two. In any case described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such paragraph one shall not be reduced below the amount provided in such subparagraph. (B) With respect to any return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand. * NB Amended Ch. 765/85 § 60, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 * (c) Underpayment due to negligence.

(2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the amount determined under paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under subdivision (a) of this section with respect to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph one which is attributable to the negligence or intentional disregard referred to in such paragraph one, for the period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for payment of such underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term \"understatement\" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable period, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return, reduced by any rebate. The amount of such understatement shall be reduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to the tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for such treatment, or any item with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return. The commissioner of finance may waive all or any part of the addition to tax provided by this subdivision on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement (or part thereof) and that the taxpayer acted in good faith. * NB Added Ch. 765/85 § 60, language juxtaposed per Ch. 907/85 § 14 * (j) Aiding or assisting in the giving of fraudulent returns, reports, statements or other documents.
