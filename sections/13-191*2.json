(2) If such actuary determines that the value of such assets, as of October thirty-first of any such calendar year for which a valuation and estimate are required by subparagraph one of this paragraph, is equal to or greater than such estimated total amount of variable supplements which would be payable for such calendar year, then the variable supplements which, upon a favorable determination of the actuary under this paragraph, are declared by subdivision four of this section to be payable to beneficiaries for such calendar year or a part thereof shall be paid by the variable supplements fund, in the applicable amounts prescribed by such subdivision four, to beneficiaries on or about the applicable December fifteenth payment date (as defined in paragraph (i) of subdivision one of this section). (3) If such actuary determines that the value of such assets, as of October thirty-first of any such calendar year for which a valuation and estimate are required by subparagraph one of this paragraph, is less than such estimated total amount of variable supplements which would be payable for such calendar year pursuant to a favorable determination of the actuary, then no beneficiary shall be entitled to receive any variable supplement for such calendar year or any part thereof and no variable supplement shall be paid to any beneficiary for such calendar year or any part thereof. (4) In any case where, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs one and three of this paragraph, no variable supplements are payable for a calendar year or part thereof to any beneficiary, no variable supplements for such calendar year or part thereof shall at any time thereafter be payable and no beneficiary shall at any time thereafter be entitled to receive a variable supplement for such calendar year or part thereof. (f) (1) Variable supplements, as provided for in subdivision four of this section, shall be paid to beneficiaries for the calendar year nineteen hundred ninety-four and for each subsequent calendar year. (2) Paragraph (e) of this subdivision shall be inapplicable with respect to entitlement of beneficiaries to variable supplements for the calendar years referred to in subparagraph one of this paragraph.

For the purposes of paragraph (i) of subdivision three of section 13-193.4 of this chapter, such valuation as of any such June thirtieth shall be the valuation for the HPOVSF basis fiscal year related to a payment guarantee (as defined in paragraph (c) of subdivision three of such section 13-193.4) in which such June thirtieth occurs. (2) The actuary shall base such annual valuation of liabilities only (i) upon the persons who, as of each such June thirtieth, are beneficiaries and (ii) upon the persons who, being housing police officers in service as of such June thirtieth, may be actuarially expected to retire thereafter as housing police officers for service with twenty or more years of service creditable toward the minimum period. (3) The liabilities determined in such valuation shall be equal to the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. The actuarial assumptions used by the actuary in making such annual valuation of liabilities, including assumptions as to interest rate, mortality of beneficiaries and number of housing police officers in service as of June thirtieth who will retire as housing police officers for service with twenty or more years of service creditable toward the minimum period, shall be adopted by the variable supplements board on the recommendation of the actuary. (h) For the purposes of the valuation of the assets of the variable supplements fund pursuant to paragraphs (e) and (g) of this subdivision, such assets shall be valued at their fair market value as of the applicable date with respect to which such assets are required to be valued under the applicable provisions of such paragraphs. (i) Whenever variable supplements are payable to beneficiaries of the housing police officer's variable supplements fund pursuant to the provisions of this section, such payment, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this subdivision, shall not be an obligation of the city and the city, except as provided for in such paragraph (f), shall not guarantee such payment. 4.

(d) For calendar years succeeding December thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-one, the variable supplements fund, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of subdivision three of this section and provided any applicable conditions precedent to payability under the provisions of such paragraph (e) are satisfied as to any calendar year to which the provisions of such paragraph (e) apply, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this subdivision, shall pay to each person who, on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-eight, was actually employed as a member of the housing police service and as a member of the retirement system and who retired for service on or after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-two so as to become a beneficiary, variable supplements payments as follows: (1) for the calendar year of retirement, an amount calculated by multiplying one-twelfth times the supplement applicable to the year of retirement, as provided for in the chart set forth in subparagraph one of paragraph (c) of this subdivision, by the number of calendar months elapsing from and including the month next following the month of retirement to the end of such calendar year of retirement, such payment to be made on or about the applicable December fifteenth payment date (as defined in paragraph (i) of subdivision one of this section); (2) for each calendar year following the year of retirement, but not including the calendar year of the beneficiary's death, a single annual payment equal to the supplement provided for with respect to each such calendar year as set forth in the chart in subparagraph one of paragraph (c) of this subdivision, which payment shall be made on or about the applicable December fifteenth payment date (as defined in paragraph (i) of subdivision one of this section); (3) for the calendar year of the beneficiary's death (for those beneficiaries who die on or after February first, nineteen hundred ninety-two), an amount calculated by multiplying one-twelfth times the supplement applicable to the year of death, as provided for in the chart set forth in subparagraph one of paragraph (c) of this subdivision, by the number of full calendar months the beneficiary lived during that calendar year prior to the month of his or her death; and (4) if the retirement and death of a beneficiary occur in the same calendar year, aggregate payments under subparagraphs one and three of this paragraph shall be made only in respect to calendar months following the month of retirement and preceding the month of death.
