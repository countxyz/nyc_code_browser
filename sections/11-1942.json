Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner or any other officer or employee of the department of finance of the city, any person engaged or retained by such commissioner or department on an independent contract basis, any depository to which any return may be delivered as provided in subdivision two of this section, any officer or employee of such depository, or any person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect any report or return or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any report or return is furnished, or to whom any information contained in any report or return is furnished, to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of wages or earnings or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any report or return required under this chapter. The commissioner or any other officer and employee charged with the custody of such reports and returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the city in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter or in any other action or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due under this chapter to which the city is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the reports, returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in any of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said reports, returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more; except as provided in subdivision (e) of section 11-1940 of this subchapter. The commissioner may, nevertheless, publish a copy or a summary of any determination or decision rendered after the hearing required under section 11-1931 of this subchapter of this chapter. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or the taxpayers's duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return or report filed in connection with his or her tax or to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and the items thereof, or the inspection by the legal representatives of the city of the report or return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding under this chapter has been recommended by the commissioner. Reports and returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the commissioner orders them to be destroyed. Any violation of the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, at the discretion of the court, and if the offender be the commissioner or any other officer or employee of the city, he or she shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office in the city or the state for a period of five years thereafter. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this section, the commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion, may require or permit any or all individuals, estates or trusts, liable for any tax imposed by this chapter, to make payments on account of estimated tax and payment of any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter to banks, banking houses or trust companies designated by the commissioner of finance and to file declarations of estimated tax and reports and returns with such banks, banking houses or trust companies as agents of the commissioner of finance, in lieu of making any such payment directly to the commissioner of finance. However, the commissioner of finance shall designate only such banks, banking houses or trust companies as are depositories or financial agents of the city. ",
