The bill of the reasonable and necessary costs, charges and expenses which by law are required to be taxed shall not be paid or allowed until they shall have been taxed by the court after notice given as in this section provided. Upon such taxation, due proof of the nature and extent of the services rendered and the disbursements charged shall be furnished, and no unnecessary costs or charges shall be allowed. All items in the bill shall be stated in detail and shall be accompanied by such proof of the reasonableness thereof and the necessity therefor, as is now required by law and the practice of the court upon taxation of costs and disbursements in other special proceedings or actions in such court. Proof by affidavit shall also be given of the dates of rendering services. No such claim for compensation, in a capital project proceeding, shall be allowed or paid unless it be accompanied by a certificate of the comptroller setting forth that the same has been audited and examined, and further certifying the result of such audit and examination. Such certificate shall be presumptive evidence of the correctness, reasonableness and necessity of such bill. b. In a capital project proceeding, the corporation counsel shall be given five days' notice of the taxation of the bill of costs, charges and expenses. c. Property owners appearing in the proceedings shall not be entitled to recover counsel fees, costs, disbursements or allowances, except as provided in sections seven hundred one and seven hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law.
