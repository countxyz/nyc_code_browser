For the purpose of computing the annuity portion of such retirement allowance, his or her accumulated deductions shall be the required amount of such deductions at the time of his or her retirement from the police force, without any increase resulting from excess contributions and without any decrease resulting from excess contributions and without any decrease resulting from withdrawals, loans, optional modification, payment of his or her contributions for old age and survivors insurance coverage, or from any other transaction authorized by law. b. Such retirement allowance shall be payable to the same persons and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including provisions as to terminations, as the retirement allowance which would otherwise be payable to the member under section 13-258 of this subchapter or any other law. c.
