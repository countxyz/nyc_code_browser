  "text": "At any time after the filing of a complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice under this chapter or an act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter six of this title, if the commission has reason to believe that the respondent or other person acting in concert with respondent is doing or procuring to be done any act or acts, tending to render ineffectual relief that could be ordered by the commission after a hearing as provided by section 8-120 of this chapter, a special proceeding may be commenced in accordance with article sixty-three of the civil practice law and rules on behalf of the commission in the supreme court for an order to show cause why the respondent and such other persons who are believed to be acting in concert with respondent should not be enjoined from doing or procuring to be done such acts. The special proceeding may be commenced in any county within the city of New York where the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice or act of discriminatory harassment or violence was committed, or where the commission maintains its principal office for the transaction of business, or where any respondent resides or maintains an office for the transaction of business, or where any person aggrieved by the unlawful discriminatory practice or act of discriminatory harassment or violence resides, or, if the complaint alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of subdivision five of section 8-107 of this chapter, where the housing accommodation, land or commercial space specified in the complaint is located. The order to show cause may contain a temporary restraining order and shall be served in the manner provided therein. On the return date of the order to show cause, and after affording the commission, the person aggrieved and the respondent and any person alleged to be acting in concert with the respondent an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant appropriate injunctive relief upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.
