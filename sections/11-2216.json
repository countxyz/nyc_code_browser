  "text": "ยง 11-2216 Notices and limitations of time. a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by him or her pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, in any application made by him or her, or in any application for registration made by him or her pursuant to section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law or, if no return has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice. b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the commissioner of motor vehicles, or the commissioner of finance if designated as his or her agent, to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time. c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period. d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this title is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of motor vehicles, commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of motor vehicles, commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of motor vehicles, commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of motor vehicles is authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. This subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States Postal Service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of motor vehicles. e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this title (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state of New York, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
