If a sum of money in gross has been or shall be assessed upon any lands or premises in the city, any person or persons claiming any divided or undivided part thereof may pay such part of the sums of money so assessed, also of the interest and charges due or charged thereon, as the commissioner of finance may deem to be just and equitable. The remainder of the sum of money so assessed, together with the interest and charges, shall be a lien upon the residue of the land and premises only, and the tax lien upon such residue may be sold in pursuance of the provisions of this chapter, to satisfy the residue of such assessment, interest, or charges thereon, in the same manner as though the residue of such assessment had been imposed upon such residue of such land or premises.
