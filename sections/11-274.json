There shall be a temporary commercial incentive area boundary commission to consist of the deputy mayor for economic development and planning, the commissioner of finance, the chair of the city planning commission, the director of management and budget, the borough presidents, the speaker of the city council and a public member appointed by the mayor to serve at the mayor's pleasure. Each member except the public member shall have the power to designate an alternate to represent him or her at commission meetings to exercise all the rights and powers of such member, including the right to vote, provided that such designation be made in writing to the chair of the commission. The deputy mayor for economic development and planning shall serve as commission chair. Each borough president shall be entitled to vote only on the designation of areas within his or her borough. Commission members who shall be officers or employees of such city shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties. Any other commission member shall receive as exclusive compensation for his or her services one hundred dollars per diem, or another reasonable amount as determined by the deputy mayor for economic development and planning, provided, however, that the total compensation paid to any such member shall not exceed twelve hundred dollars for any calendar year, or another reasonable amount determined by the deputy mayor for economic development and planning. A majority of members of such commission entitled to vote on a matter shall constitute a quorum for such issue. Decisions shall be made by majority vote of those present entitled to vote on a matter. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no officer or employee of the state or any of its subdivisions or any public benefit corporation shall be deemed to have forfeited his or her office or employment or any benefits provided under the retirement and social security law or under any public retirement system maintained by the state or any of its subdivisions by reason of accepting membership on such commission. b. Designation of special commercial abatement areas. (1) The commission shall meet in two thousand nine and at least once every five years thereafter to determine the boundaries of special commercial abatement areas which it is authorized, but not required, to designate pursuant to this section. The areas designated by the commission established pursuant to title two-D of article four of the real property tax law in effect as of June thirtieth, two thousand eight shall remain in effect until the first taxable status date after the city council approves a new designation pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (2) In years when special commercial abatement areas are to be designated, no later than October first, the commission shall provide public notice of such designation by publishing a notice at least once in a newspaper of general circulation setting forth the proposed boundaries. Notice may also be provided electronically or in an electronic medium, such as a website, in a manner the commission determines to be appropriate. Notice must be provided not earlier than five nor later than fifteen days before the date of the commission's public hearing to hear all persons interested in the designation of the areas. The notice required by this paragraph shall be published in the City Record and a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and copies thereof shall be forwarded to each council member and community board. (3) The commission shall make such designation, and notify the city council of such designation, not later than November first of each year when special commercial abatement areas are to be designated. (4) Within thirty days after the first stated meeting of the city council following the receipt of notice of such designation, the city council may, by majority vote, disapprove such designation. If, within such thirty-day period, the city council fails to act or fails to act by the required vote, the city council shall be deemed to have approved such designation. Such designation shall take effect on the first taxable status date after the city council approves such designation and shall remain in effect until the first taxable status date after the city council approves such new designation. (5) The commission may designate any area other than the area lying south of the center line of 96th Street in the borough of Manhattan, to be a special commercial abatement area if it determines that market conditions in the area are such that the availability of a special abatement is required in order to encourage commercial construction work in such area. In making such determination, the commission shall consider, among other factors, the existence in such area of a special need for commercial and job development, high unemployment, economic distress or unusually large numbers of vacant, underutilized, unsuitable or substandard structures, or other substandard, unsanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, with or without tangible blight. (6) If the commission fails to meet for more than five years, all new applications for special commercial abatement area benefits postmarked after the fifth anniversary of the commission's last meeting shall be deemed applications for regular area benefits. c. Renovation areas. The following areas in the borough of Manhattan shall be designated as renovation areas. Except as provided in paragraph (6) of subdivision c of section 11-269 of this part, new commercial construction in a renovation area shall not be eligible for abatement benefits. Renovation areas shall be limited to: (1) the area in the borough of Manhattan bounded by Murray Street on the north starting at the intersection of West Street and Murray Street; running easterly along the center line of Murray Street; connecting through City Hall Park with the center line of Frankfort Street and running easterly along the center line of Frankfort and Dover Streets to the intersection of Dover Street and South Street; running southerly along the center line of South Street to Peter Minuit Plaza; connecting through Peter Minuit Plaza to the center line of State Street and running northwesterly along the center line of State Street to the intersection of State Street and Battery Place; running westerly along the center line of Battery Place to the intersection of Battery Place and West Street; and running northerly along the center line of West Street to the intersection of West Street and Murray Street; (2) the area in the borough of Manhattan defined as the special garment center district by chapter one of article XII of the zoning resolution of the city; and (3) the area in the borough of Manhattan south of the center line of 59th street, other than the areas designated renovation areas by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. d. Commercial exclusion area. Except as provided in paragraph (6) of subdivision c of section 11-269 of this part, any area in the borough of Manhattan lying south of the center line of 96th Street, other than the areas designated renovation areas by subdivision c of this section, shall be a commercial exclusion area. Commercial construction projects in the commercial exclusion area shall not be eligible to receive tax abatements pursuant to this part. e. Eligible industrial construction projects may receive tax abatements pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (5) of subdivision c of section 11-269 of this part in any area of the city. ",
