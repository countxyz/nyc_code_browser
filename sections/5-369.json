Such appeal shall be heard, on due notice thereof being given, according to the rules and practice of such court, and pending such appeal the comptroller shall deposit in such trust company as the court shall direct, the amount of the award, with interest to the date of such deposit and the funds so deposited shall remain with the trust company, subject to the further order of the court. On the hearing of such appeal the court may direct a new trial by the supreme court and either party if aggrieved, may take a further appeal, which shall be heard and determined by the court of appeals. If the amount of compensation to be made by the city shall be increased at the second trial, the difference shall be paid by the comptroller to the parties entitled to the same, or shall be deposited, as the court may direct; and if the amount shall be diminished, the difference shall be refunded to the city by the trust company. The taking of an appeal by any person or persons, however, shall not operate to stay the proceedings under this subchapter, providing such award and interest have been deposited. ",
