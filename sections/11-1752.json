The commissioner shall prescribe by regulation the place for filing any return, statement, or other document required pursuant to this chapter and for payment of any tax. (b) The commissioner of taxation and finance may allow individuals who have income only from wages, salaries, tips and like remuneration for services performed as an employee, interest, dividends and unemployment compensation to elect to have the commissioner compute the tax due. To provide for expeditious and uniform administration of the tax computations which involve numerous variables, the commissioner may further qualify, with regard to period of residency, deductions, credits, exemptions, amount and character of gross income, and any other appropriate factors relative to calculation of tax, those individuals who may elect to have their taxes computed by the commissioner. Any such election shall be made on the form prescribed by the commissioner for this purpose. If a qualified taxpayer elects to have the commissioner compute the tax, the amount determined by the commissioner shall be paid (i) within ten days from the date of the issuance of a notice and demand therefor or (ii) on the date fixed for filing such return (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing), whichever is later.
