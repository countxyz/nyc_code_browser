If a taxpayer fails to comply with subdivision d of section 11-1104 of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction of its sales and compensating use tax liability or in not filing a copy of an amended return or report relating to its sales and compensating use tax liability, instead of the mode and time of assessment provided for in section 11-1106 of this chapter, the commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon such changed or corrected sales and compensating use tax liability, as same relates to credits claimed under this chapter, by mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the interest and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed on the date such notice is mailed unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the state change or correction or a copy of an amended return or report, where such copy was required, is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such state determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous. Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of determination for the purposes of section 11-1106 of this chapter. b. If a report filed pursuant to subdivision d of section 11-1104 of this chapter concedes the accuracy of a state change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability, any deficiency in tax resulting therefor shall be deemed assessed on the date of filing such report.
