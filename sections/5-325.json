Such appeal shall be taken and heard in the manner provided by the civil practice law and rules and the rules and practice of the court of appeals in relation to appeals from orders in special proceedings. An appeal taken but not prosecuted within six months after the filing of the notice of appeal, unless the time within which to prosecute the same shall have been extended by an order of the court, shall be deemed to be abandoned, and no agreement between the parties to the appeal extending the time to prosecute the same shall vary the provisions hereof. The court of appeals may affirm or reverse the order appealed from, and may make such order or direction as shall be appropriate to the case. If the final decree or decrees of the court shall be reversed by the court of appeals, such reversal shall not divest the city of title to the real property affected by the appeal. ",
