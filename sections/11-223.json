If a sum of money in gross has been or shall be taxed upon any lands or premises, any person or persons claiming any dividend or undivided part thereof may pay such part of such sum so taxed and of any interest and charges due or charged thereon, as the commissioner of finance may deem to be just and equitable. b. The commissioner of finance shall apportion the assessed valuation of such lands or premises. c. The remainder of the sum of money so taxed and the interest and charges shall be a lien upon the residue of the land and premises only, and the tax lien upon such residue may be sold to satisfy such tax, interest or charges thereon, in the same manner as though the residue of said tax had been imposed only upon such residue of such lands or premises.
