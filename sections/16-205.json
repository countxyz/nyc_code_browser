There shall be in the department a solid waste management board consisting of the commissioner, the commissioner of consumer affairs and the executive director of the office for economic development, all of whom shall serve on the board without compensation and all of whom shall have the power to exercise or delegate any of their functions, powers and duties as members of the board. Such board may grant variances from a regulation or modify assignments or rates of the commissioner involving the transportation, storage, processing or disposal of solid waste when such board finds that such regulation or order would impose unreasonable economic hardship. The specific terms of any variance granted shall be determined by such board on a case by case basis. Any person seeking a variance shall do so by filing with such board a petition for variance in a form prescribed by such board. Such forms shall document the need for a variance. b. Exemptions from formal variance request procedures may be made for day-to-day operational hardships such as equipment failure. The commissioner may grant temporary facility and time assignment variances to persons who report such hardships to the commissioner. Proof of hardship must be submitted to the commissioner within the time frame set by the commissioner. Subsequent exemptions may be withheld for failing to submit proof of hardship for any prior request. ",
