An applicant may submit to the commission any material or explanation which the applicant believes demonstrates that any information submitted pursuant to subparagraphs (g), (h), (i), or (j) of this paragraph does not reflect adversely upon the applicant's good character, honesty and integrity. The commission may require that such applicants pay such fees to cover the expenses of fingerprinting and background investigations provided for in this subdivision as are set forth in the rules promulgated pursuant to section 16-504 of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, for purposes of this section: (A) in the case of an applicant which is a regional subsidiary of or otherwise owned, managed by or affiliated with a business that has national or international operations: (aa) (i) fingerprinting and disclosure under this section shall also be required of any persons not employed by the applicant who has direct management supervisory responsibility for the operations or performance of the applicant; and (ii) the chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, or any person exercising comparable responsibilities and functions, of any regional subsidiary or similar entity of such business over which any person subject to fingerprinting and disclosure under item (i) of this clause exercises similar responsibilities shall be fingerprinted and shall submit the information required pursuant to subparagraphs (g) and (h) of this paragraph, as well as such additional information pursuant to this paragraph as the commission may find necessary; and (bb) the listing specified under subparagraph (j) of this paragraph shall also be provided for any regional subsidiary or similar entity of the national or international business for which fingerprinting and disclosure by principals thereof is made pursuant to (aa) of this paragraph; and (B) \"predecessor trade waste business\" shall mean any business engaged in the removal, collection or disposal of trade waste in which one or more principals of the applicant were principals in the five year period preceding the application. For purposes of determining the good character, honesty and integrity of a business that removes, collects or disposes of trade waste, a trade waste broker or a business issued a registration by reason of the grant pursuant to section 16-505 of this chapter of an exemption from the requirement for a license, the term \"applicant\" shall apply to the business of such trade waste business, trade waste broker or exempt business and, except as specified by the commission, all the principals thereof; for purposes of investigations of employees or agents pursuant to section 16-510 of this chapter, the term \"applicant\" as used herein shall be deemed to apply to employees, agents or prospective employees or agents of an applicant for a license or a licensee. Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision, the commission may accept, in lieu of submissions required pursuant to this subdivision, information, such as copies of submissions to any federal, state or local regulatory entity, where and to the extent that the commission finds that the contents of such submissions are sufficient or comparable to that required by this subdivision. c. A licensee shall, in accordance with rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to section 16-504 of this chapter, inform the commission of any changes in the ownership composition of the licensee, the addition or deletion of any principal at any time subsequent to the issuance of the license, membership in a trade association in addition to an association identified in the application submitted pursuant to this section, the arrest or criminal conviction of any principal of the business, or any other material change in the information submitted on the application for a license. A licensee shall provide the commission with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition of a new principal to the business of such licensee. The commission may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the commission determines within such period, based upon information available to it, that the addition of such new principal may have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, the licensee may add such new principal pending the completion of review by the commission. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commission that the addition of such new principal pending completion of such review would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the completion of such review, the commission determines that such principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall cease to be valid unless such principal divests his or her interest, or discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such license, as the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the commission. d. Each applicant shall provide the commission with a business address in New York city where notices may be delivered and legal process served. ",
