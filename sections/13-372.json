(ii) The accumulated contributions of such member as an original plan member shall remain in the retirement allowance reserve fund and shall not be transferred to his or her credit in the annuity savings fund.

(2) Such total service credit to which any such restored member referred to in paragraph one of this subdivision b was entitled at the time of his or her earlier retirement shall be credited as provided in such paragraph one only in the event that he or she returns to the pension fund with regular interest the actuarial equivalent of the amount of the retirement allowance he or she received; provided, however, that in the event that such amount is not so repaid, the actuarial equivalent thereof shall be deducted from his or her subsequent retirement allowance. (3) In any case where any restored member who is eligible for and elects the crediting of his or her total service credit (to which he or she was entitled at the time of his or her earlier retirement) pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs one and two of this subdivision b became an improved benefits plan member by election made pursuant to the provisions of section 13-315 of this subchapter after his or her restoration to membership, he or she shall, upon his or her subsequent retirement, receive for such total service credit a retirement allowance determined pursuant to the provisions of section 13-359 of this subchapter, and he or she shall not receive any other retirement allowance or benefit for such total service credit.
