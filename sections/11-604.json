The amount of subsidiary capital, investment capital and business capital shall each be determined by taking the average value of the gross assets included therein (less liabilities deductible therefrom pursuant to the provisions of subdivisions three, four and six of section 11-602 of this subchapter), and, if the period covered by the report is other than a period of twelve calendar months, by multiplying such value by the number of calendar months or major parts thereof included in such period, and dividing the product thus obtained by twelve. For purposes of this subdivision, real property and marketable securities shall be valued at fair market value and the value of personal property other than marketable securities shall be the value thereof shown on the books and records of the taxpayer in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 3. The portion of the entire net income of a taxpayer to be allocated within the city shall be determined as follows: (a) multiply its business income by a business allocation percentage to be determined by: (1) ascertaining the percentage which the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property, whether owned or rented to it, within the city during the period covered by its report bears to the average value of all the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property, whether owned or rented to it, wherever situated during such period. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term \"value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property\" shall mean the adjusted bases of such properties for federal income tax purposes (except that in the case of rented property such value shall mean the product of (A) eight and (B) the gross rents payable for the rental of such property during the taxable year); provided, however, that the taxpayer may make a one-time, revocable election, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the commissioner of finance to use fair market value as the value of all of its real and tangible personal property, provided that such election is made on or before the due date for filing a report under section 11-605 of this subchapter for the taxpayer's first taxable year commencing on or after January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight and provided that such election shall not apply to any taxable year with respect to which the taxpayer is included on a combined report unless each of the taxpayers included on such report has made such an election which remains in effect for such year;

(3) ascertaining the percentage of the total wages, salaries and other personal service compensation, similarly computed, during such period of employees within the city, except general executive officers, to the total wages, salaries and other personal service compensation, similarly computed, during such period of all the taxpayer's employees within and without the city, except general executive officers, and (4) adding together the percentages so determined and dividing the result by the number of percentages; provided, however, that for taxable years beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six, a taxpayer that is a \"manufacturing corporation,\" as defined in subparagraph eight of this paragraph, may determine its business allocation percentage as provided in such subparagraph eight; and provided, further, however, that for taxable years beginning before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six, if the taxpayer does not have a regular place of business outside the city other than a statutory office, the business allocation percentage shall be one hundred per centum. (5) Rules for receipts from certain services to investment companies. (A) For purposes of subclause (ii) of clause (B) of subparagraph two of this paragraph, the portion of receipts received from an investment company arising from the sale of management, administration or distribution services to such investment company determined in accordance with clause (B) of this subparagraph shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city (such portion referred to herein as the New York city portion). (B) The New York city portion shall be the product of (a) the total of such receipts from the sale of such services and (b) a fraction. The numerator of that fraction is the sum of the monthly percentages (as defined hereinafter) determined for each month of the investment company's taxable year for federal income tax purposes which taxable year ends within the taxable year of the taxpayer (but excluding any month during which the investment company had no outstanding shares). The monthly percentage for each such month is determined by dividing (a) the number of shares in the investment company which are owned on the last day of the month by shareholders which are domiciled in the city by (b) the total number of shares in the investment company outstanding on that date. The denominator of the fraction is the number of such monthly percentages. (C) (i) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \"domicile\", in the case of an individual, shall have the meaning ascribed to it under chapter seventeen of this title; an estate or trust is domiciled in the city if it is a city resident estate or trust as defined in paragraph three of subdivision (b) of section 11-1705 of this code; a business entity is domiciled in the city if the location of the actual seat of management or control is in the city.

(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \"distribution services\" means the services of advertising, servicing investor accounts (including redemptions), marketing shares or selling shares of an investment company, but, in the case of advertising, servicing investor accounts (including redemptions) or marketing shares, only where such service is performed by a person who is (or was, in the case of a closed end company) also engaged in the service of selling such shares. In the case of an open end company, such service of selling shares must be performed pursuant to a contract entered into pursuant to section 15(b) of the federal investment company act of nineteen hundred forty, as amended. (vi) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \"administration services\" includes (1) clerical, accounting, bookkeeping, data processing, internal auditing, legal and tax services performed for an investment company but only (2) if the provider of such service or services during the taxable year in which such service or services are sold also sells management or distribution services, as defined hereinabove, to such investment company. (6) (A) Provided, further, however, that a taxpayer principally engaged in the conduct of aviation (other than as provided in clause (C) of this subparagraph) shall, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, determine the portion of entire net income to be allocated within the city by multiplying its business income by a business allocation percentage which is equal to the arithmetic average of the following three percentages: (i) the percentage determined by dividing aircraft arrivals and departures within the city by the taxpayer during the period covered by its report by the total aircraft arrivals and departures within and without the city during such period; provided, however, arrivals and departures solely for maintenance or repair, refueling (where no debarkation or embarkation of traffic occurs), arrivals and departures of ferry and personnel training flights or arrivals and departures in the event of emergency situations shall not be included in computing such arrival and departure percentage; provided, further, the commissioner of finance may also exempt from such percentage aircraft arrivals and departures of all non-revenue flights including flights involving the transportation of officers or employees receiving air transportation to perform maintenance or repair services or where such officers or employees are transported in conjunction with an emergency situation or the investigation of an air disaster (other than on a scheduled flight); provided, however, that arrivals and departures of flights transporting officers and employees receiving air transportation for purposes other than specified above (without regard to remuneration) shall be included in computing such arrival and departure percentage; (ii) the percentage determined by dividing the revenue tons handled by the taxpayer at airports within the city during such period by the total revenue tons handled by it at airports within and without the city during such period; and (iii) the percentage determined by dividing the taxpayer's originating revenue within the city for such period by its total originating revenue within and without the city for such period. (B) As used herein, the term \"aircraft arrivals and departures\" means the number of landings and takeoffs of the aircraft of the taxpayer and the number of air pickups and deliveries by the aircraft of such taxpayer; the term \"originating revenue\" means revenue to the taxpayer from the transportation of revenue passengers and revenue property first received by the taxpayer either as originating or connecting traffic at airports; and the term \"revenue tons handled\" by the taxpayer at airports means the weight in tons of revenue passengers (at two hundred pounds per passenger) and revenue cargo first received either as originating or connecting traffic or finally discharged by the taxpayer at airports; (C) A foreign air carrier described in the first sentence of subparagraph one of paragraph (c-1) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter shall determine its business allocation percentage pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs one through four of this paragraph, except that the numerators and denominators involved in such computation shall exclude property to the extent employed in generating income excluded from entire net income pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c-1) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter, exclude such receipts as are excluded from entire net income for the taxable year pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c-1) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter, and exclude wages, salaries or other personal service compensation which are directly attributable to the generation of income excluded from entire net income for the taxable year pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c-1) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter. (7) Provided, further, however, that a taxpayer principally engaged in the operation of vessels shall, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, determine the portion of entire net income to be allocated within the city by multiplying its business income by a business allocation percentage determined by dividing the aggregate number of working days of the vessels it owns or leases in territorial waters of the city during the period covered by its report by the aggregate number of working days of all the vessels it owns or leases during such period. (8) (A) For taxable years beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six and before January first, two thousand eleven, a manufacturing corporation may elect to determine its business allocation percentage by adding together the percentages determined under subparagraphs one, two and three of this paragraph and an additional percentage equal to the percentage determined under subparagraph two of this paragraph, and dividing the result by the number of percentages so added together. (B) An election under this subparagraph must be made on a timely filed (determined with regard to extensions granted) original report for the taxable year. Once made for a taxable year, such election shall be irrevocable for that taxable year. A separate election must be made for each taxable year. A manufacturing corporation that has failed to make an election as provided in this clause shall be required to determine its business allocation percentage without regard to the provisions of this subparagraph. Notwithstanding anything in this clause to the contrary, the commissioner of finance may permit a manufacturing corporation to make or revoke an election under this subparagraph, upon such terms and conditions as the commissioner may prescribe, where the commissioner determines that such permission should be granted in the interests of fairness and equity due to a change in circumstances resulting from an audit adjustment. (C) As used in this subparagraph, the term \"manufacturing corporation\" means a corporation primarily engaged in the manufacturing and sale thereof of tangible personal property; and the term \"manufacturing\" includes the process (including the assembly process) (i) of working raw materials into wares suitable for use or (ii) which gives new shapes, new qualities or new combinations to matter which already has gone through some artificial process, by the use of machinery, tools, appliances and other similar equipment. A corporation shall be deemed to be primarily engaged in the activities described in the preceding sentence if more than fifty percent of its gross receipts for the taxable year are attributable to such activities. (D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if a taxpayer that is otherwise eligible to make the election authorized by this subparagraph is required or permitted to make a report on a combined basis with one or more other corporations pursuant to subdivision four of section 11-605 of this chapter, the taxpayer shall be permitted to make an election under this subparagraph only if such taxpayer and such other corporation or corporations would be a manufacturing corporation if they were treated as a single corporation. In making such determination, intercorporate transactions shall be eliminated. Where such election has been made by the taxpayer for a taxable year, each of the other corporations included in the combined report shall also be deemed to have made a proper election under this subparagraph for such taxable year. (9) Special rules for publishers and broadcasters. (A) Notwithstanding anything in subparagraph two of this paragraph to the contrary and except as provided in clause (C) of this subparagraph, in the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of publishing newspapers or periodicals, there shall be allocated to the city, for purposes of subparagraph two of this paragraph, the gross sales or charges for services arising from sales of advertising contained in such newspapers or periodicals, to the extent that such newspapers or periodicals are delivered to points within the city. (B) Notwithstanding anything in subparagraph two of this paragraph to the contrary and except as provided in clause (C) of this subparagraph, in the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of broadcasting radio or television programs, whether through the public airwaves or by cable, direct or indirect satellite transmission, or any other means of transmission, there shall be allocated to the city, for purposes of subparagraph two of this paragraph, a portion of the gross sales or charges for services arising from the broadcasting of such programs and of commercial messages in connection therewith, such portion to be determined according to the number of listeners or viewers within and without the city. (C) Notwithstanding anything in clause (A) or (B) of this subparagraph to the contrary, in the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of publishing newspapers or periodicals, or broadcasting radio or television programs, whether through the public airwaves or by cable, direct or indirect satellite transmission, or any other means of transmission, there shall be allocated to the city, for purposes of subparagraph two of this paragraph, the gross sales or charges to subscribers located in the city for subscriptions to such newspapers, periodicals, or program services. For purposes of this clause, a subscriber shall be deemed located in the city if, in the case of newspapers and periodicals, the mailing address for the subscription is within the city and, in the case of program services, the billing address for the subscription is within the city.

(i) Receipts constituting brokerage commissions derived from the execution of securities or commodities purchase or sales orders for the accounts of customers shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such commissions. (ii) Receipts constituting margin interest earned on behalf of brokerage accounts shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such margin interest. (iii) Gross income, including any accrued interest or dividends, from principal transactions for the purchase or sale of stocks, bonds, foreign exchange and other securities or commodities (including futures and forward contracts, options and other types of securities or commodities derivatives contracts) shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city either (I) to the extent that production credits are awarded to branches, offices or employees of the taxpayer within the city as a result of such principal transactions or (II) if the taxpayer so elects, to the extent that the gross proceeds from such principal transactions (determined without deduction for any cost incurred by the taxpayer to acquire the securities or commodities) are generated from sales of securities or commodities to customers within the city based upon the mailing addresses of such customers in the records of the taxpayer. For purposes of subitem (II) of the preceding sentence, the taxpayer shall separately calculate such gross income from principal transactions by type of security or commodity. For purposes of this item, gross income from principal transactions shall be determined after the deduction of any cost incurred by the taxpayer to acquire the securities or commodities. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \"production credits\" means credits granted pursuant to the internal accounting system used by the taxpayer to measure the amount of revenue that should be awarded to a particular branch or office or employee of the taxpayer which is based, at least in part, on the branch's, the office's or the employee's particular activities. Upon request, the taxpayer shall be required to furnish a detailed explanation of such internal accounting system to the department. (iv) (I) Receipts constituting fees earned by the taxpayer for advisory services to a customer in connection with the underwriting of securities for such customer (such customer being the entity which is contemplating issuing or is issuing securities) or fees earned by the taxpayer for managing an underwriting shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of such customer who is responsible for paying such fees. (II) Receipts constituting the primary spread or selling concession from underwritten securities shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city to the extent that production credits are awarded to branches, offices or employees of the taxpayer within the city as a result of the sale of the underwritten securities. (III) The term \"primary spread\" means the difference between the price paid by the taxpayer to the issuer of the securities being marketed and the price received from the subsequent sale of the underwritten securities at the initial public offering price, less any selling concession and any fees paid to the taxpayer for advisory services or any manager's fees, if such fees are not paid by the customer to the taxpayer separately. The term \"public offering price\" means the price agreed upon by the taxpayer and the issuer at which the securities are to be offered to the public. The term \"selling concession\" means the amount paid to the taxpayer for participating in the underwriting of a security where the taxpayer is not the lead underwriter. (v) Receipts constituting interest earned by the taxpayer on loans and advances made by the taxpayer to a corporation affiliated with the taxpayer but with which the taxpayer is not permitted or required to file a combined report pursuant to subdivision four of section 11-605 of this subchapter shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the principal place of business of such affiliated corporation. (vi) Receipts constituting account maintenance fees shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such account maintenance fees. (vii) Receipts constituting fees for management or advisory services, including fees for advisory services in relation to merger or acquisition activities but excluding fees paid for services described in item (ii) of clause (B) of subparagraph two of this paragraph, shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such fees. (B) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \"securities\" shall have the same meaning as in section 475(c)(2) of the internal revenue code and the term \"commodities\" shall have the same meaning as in section 475(e)(2) of the internal revenue code. The term \"registered securities or commodities broker or dealer\" means a broker or dealer registered as such by the securities and exchange commission or the commodities futures trading commission, and shall include an over-the-counter derivatives dealer as defined under regulations of the securities and exchange commission at title 17, part 240, section 3b-12 of the code of federal regulations (17 CFR 240.3b-12). (C) If the taxpayer receives any of the receipts enumerated in clause (A) of this subparagraph as a result of a securities correspondent relationship such taxpayer has with another registered securities or commodities broker or dealer with the taxpayer acting in this relationship as the clearing firm, such receipts shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city to the extent set forth in each of the items of clause (A) of this subparagraph. The amount of such receipts shall exclude the amount the taxpayer is required to pay to the correspondent firm for such correspondent relationship. If the taxpayer receives any of the receipts enumerated in clause (A) of this subparagraph as a result of a securities correspondent relationship such taxpayer has with another registered securities or commodities broker or dealer with the taxpayer acting in this relationship as the introducing firm, such receipts shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city to the extent set forth in each of the items of clause (A) of this subparagraph. (D) If, for purposes of item (i) or (ii), subitem (I) of item (iv), or item (vi), or (vii) of clause (A) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer is unable from its records to determine the mailing address of the customer, the receipts enumerated in any of such items shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the branch or office of the taxpayer that generates the transaction for the customer that generated such receipts. * NB There are 2 รน(10)'s (b) multiply its investment income by an investment allocation percentage to be determined by: (1) multiplying the amount of its investment capital invested in each stock, bond or other security (other than governmental securities) during the period covered by its report by the issuer's allocation percentage of the issuer or obligor thereof. (i) In the case of an issuer or obligor subject to tax under this subchapter or subchapter four of this chapter, or subject to tax as a utility corporation under chapter eleven of this title, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be the percentage of the appropriate measure (as defined hereinafter) which is required to be allocated within the city on the report or reports, if any, required of the issuer or obligor under this title for the preceding year. The appropriate measure referred to in the preceding sentence shall be: in the case of an issuer or obligor subject to this subchapter, entire capital; in the case of an issuer or obligor subject to subchapter four of this chapter, issued capital stock; in the case of an issuer or obligor subject to chapter eleven of this title as a utility corporation, gross income. (ii) In the case of an issuer or obligor subject to tax under part four of subchapter three of this chapter, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be determined as follows: (A) In the case of a banking corporation described in paragraphs one through eight of subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this chapter which is organized under the laws of the United States, this state or any other state of the United States, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be its alternative entire net income allocation percentage, as defined in subdivision (c) of section 11-642 of this chapter, for the preceding year. In the case of such a banking corporation whose alternative entire net income for the preceding year is derived exclusively from business carried on within the city, its issuer's allocation percentage shall be one hundred percent. (B) In the case of a banking corporation described in paragraph two of subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this chapter which is organized under the laws of a country other than the United States, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be determined by dividing (I) the amount described in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph two of subdivision (a) of section 11-642 of this chapter with respect to such issuer or obligor for the preceding year, by (II) the gross income of such issuer or obligor from all sources within and without the United States, for such preceding year, whether or not included in alternative entire net income for such year. (C) In the case of an issuer or obligor described in paragraph nine of subdivision (a) or in paragraph two of subdivision (d) of section 11-640 of this chapter, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be determined by dividing the portion of the entire capital of the issuer or obligor allocable to the city for the preceding year by the entire capital, wherever located, of the issuer or obligor for the preceding year. (iii) Provided, however, that if a report or reports for the preceding year are not filed, or if filed do not contain information which would permit the determination of such issuer's allocation percentage, then the issuer's allocation percentage to be used shall, at the discretion of the commissioner of finance, be either (A) the issuer's allocation percentage derived from the most recently filed report or reports of the issuer or obligor or (B) a percentage calculated, by the commissioner of finance, reasonably to indicate the degree of economic presence in the city of the issuer or obligor during the preceding year. (2) adding together the sum so obtained, and (3) dividing the result so obtained by the total of its investment capital invested during such period in stocks, bonds and other securities; provided, however, that in case any investment capital is invested in any stock, bond or other security during only a portion of the period covered by the report, only such portion of such capital shall be taken into account; and provided further, that if a taxpayer's investment allocation percentage is zero, interest received on bank accounts shall be multiplied by its business allocation percentage; and (c) add the products so obtained. (d) Except as provided in subparagraph three of this paragraph or in paragraph (e) of this subdivision, at the election of the taxpayer there shall be deducted from the portion of its entire net income allocated within the city either or both of the items set forth in subparagraphs one and two of this paragraph, except that only one of such deductions shall be allowed with respect to any one item of property. (1) Depreciation with respect to any property such as described in subparagraph three of this paragraph, not exceeding twice the depreciation allowed with respect to the same property for federal income tax purposes. Such deduction shall be allowed only upon condition that entire net income be computed without any deduction for the depreciation of the same property, and the total of all deductions allowed in any taxable year or years with respect to the depreciation of any such property shall not exceed its cost or other basis. (2) Expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the construction, reconstruction, erection or acquisition of any property such as described in subparagraph three of this paragraph which is used or to be used for purposes of research and development in the experimental or laboratory sense. Such purposes shall not be deemed to include the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for quality control, efficiency surveys, management studies, consumer surveys, advertising, promotions or research in connection with literary, historical or similar projects. Such deduction shall be allowed only on condition that entire net income for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years be computed without the deduction of any such expenditures and without any deduction for depreciation of the same property, except to the extent that its basis may be attributable to factors other than such expenditures, or in case a deduction is allowable pursuant to this subparagraph for only a part of such expenditures, on condition that any deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes on account of such expenditures or on account of depreciation of the same property be proportionately reduced in computing entire net income for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years. With respect to property which is used or to be used for research and development only in part, or during only part of its useful life, a proportionate part of such expenditures shall be deductible. If all or part of such expenditures with respect to any property shall have been deducted as provided herein, and such property is used for purposes other than research and development to a greater extent than originally reported, the taxpayer shall report such use in its report for the first taxable year during which it occurs, and the commissioner of finance may recompute the tax for the year or years for which such deduction was allowed, and may assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation regardless of the time limitations set forth in section 11-674 of this chapter. (3) Such deductions shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in the city and used in the taxpayer's trade or business, (A) constructed, reconstructed or erected after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or, property, the physical construction, reconstruction or erection of which began on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven or which began after such date pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof or the expenditures relating thereto which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or (B) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in the city and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or (C) acquired, constructed, reconstructed, or erected subsequent to December thirty-first nineteen hundred sixty-seven, if such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection is pursuant to a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven and not thereafter substantially modified, and such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection would qualify under the rules in paragraphs four, five or six of subsection (h) of section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references in such paragraphs four, five and six to the dates October nine, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven. A taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this subparagraph only if the tangible property shall be delivered or the construction, reconstruction or erection shall be completed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine, except in the case of tangible property which is acquired, constructed, reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer. Provided, however, for any taxable year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph (d) hereof with respect to tangible personal property leased by it to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which the taxpayer uses itself for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, the taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under paragraph (d) in proportion to the part of the year it uses such property. (4) If the deductions allowable for any taxable year, pursuant to this subdivision, exceed the portion of the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to the city for such year, the excess may be carried over to the following taxable year or years and may be deducted from the portion of the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to the city for such year or years. (5) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to subparagraph one or two of this paragraph, the gain or loss thereon entering into the computation of federal taxable income shall be disregarded in computing entire net income, and there shall be added to or subtracted from the portion of entire net income allocated within the city the gain or loss upon such sale or other disposition. In computing such gain or loss the basis of the property sold or disposed of shall be adjusted to reflect the deduction allowed with respect to such property pursuant to subparagraph one or two of this paragraph. Provided, however, that no loss shall be recognized for the purposes of this subparagraph with respect to a sale or other disposition of property to a person whose acquisition thereof is not a purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code. (e) At the election of the taxpayer there shall be deducted from the portion of its entire net income allocated within the city either or both of the items set forth in subparagraphs one and two of this paragraph, except that only one of such deductions shall be allowed with respect to any one item of property. (1) Depreciation with respect to any property such as described in subparagraphs three and four of this paragraph, not exceeding twice the depreciation allowed with respect to the same property for federal income tax purposes. Such deduction shall be allowed only upon condition that entire net income be computed without any deduction for the depreciation of the same property, and the total of all deductions allowed in any taxable year or years with respect to the depreciation of any such property shall not exceed its cost or other basis multiplied by the taxpayer's business allocation percentage determined under this subdivision for the first year it deducts such depreciation under this paragraph. (2) Expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the construction, reconstruction, erection or acquisition of any property such as described in subparagraph three of this paragraph which is used or to be used for purposes of research and development in the experimental or laboratory sense. Such purposes shall not be deemed to include the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for quality control, efficiency surveys, management studies, consumer surveys, advertising, promotions or research in connection with literary, historical or similar projects. Such deductions shall be allowed only on condition that it does not exceed the amount of the expenditures multiplied by the taxpayer's business allocation percentage determined under this subdivision for the year the expenditures are paid or incurred and that entire net income for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years be computed without the deduction of any such expenditures and without any deduction for depreciation of the same property, except to the extent that its basis may be attributable to factors other than such expenditures, or in case a deduction is allowable pursuant to this subparagraph for only a part of such expenditures, on condition that any deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes on account of such expenditures or on account of depreciation of the same property be proportionately reduced in computing entire net income for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years. With respect to property which is used or to be used for research and development only in part, or during only part of its useful life, a proportionate part of such expenditures shall be deductible. If all or part of such expenditures with respect to any property shall have been deducted as provided herein, and such property is used for purposes other than research and development to a greater extent than originally reported, the taxpayer shall report such use in its report for the first taxable year during which it occurs, and the commissioner of finance may recompute the tax for the year or years for which such deduction was allowed, and may assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation regardless of the time limitations set forth in section 11-674 of this chapter. (3) Such deduction shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in the city and used in the taxpayer's trade or business (A) the construction, reconstruction or erection of which is completed after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof or the expenditures relating thereto which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or (B) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven by purchase or defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in this state and commenced after December thirty-first nineteen hundred sixty-five. Provided, however, for any taxable year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph (e) hereof with respect to tangible personal property leased by it to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which the taxpayer uses itself for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, the taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under paragraph (e) in proportion to the part of the year it uses such property. (4) A deduction under subparagraph one of this paragraph shall be allowed with respect to tangible property described in subparagraph three only if such property is principally used by the taxpayer in the production of goods by manufacturing; processing; assembling; refining; mining; extracting; farming; agriculture; horticulture; floriculture; viticulture or commercial fishing. For purposes of this subparagraph, manufacturing shall mean the process of working raw materials into wares suitable for use or which gives new shapes, new qualities or new combinations to matter which already has gone through some artificial process by the use of machinery, tools, appliances and other similar equipment. Property used in the production of goods shall include machinery, equipment or other tangible property which is principally used in the repair and service of other machinery, equipment or other tangible property used principally in the production of goods and shall include all facilities used in the manufacturing operation, including storage of material to be used in manufacturing and of the products that are manufactured. At the option of the taxpayer, air and water pollution control facilities which qualify for elective deductions under paragraph (g) of subdivision eight of section 11-602 of this subchapter may be treated, for purposes of this paragraph, as tangible property principally used in the production of goods by manufacturing; processing; assembling; refining; mining; extracting; farming; agriculture; horticulture; floriculture; viticulture; or commercial fishing, in which event, a deduction shall not be allowed under such paragraph (g). (5) Subject to the limitation imposed by subparagraphs one and two hereof, if the deductions allowable for any taxable year, pursuant to this subdivision, exceed the portion of the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to the city for such year, the excess may be carried over to the following taxable year or years and may be deducted from the portion of the taxpayer's entire net income allocated to the city for such year or years. (6) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to subparagraph one or two of this paragraph, the gain or loss thereon entering into the computation of federal taxable income shall be disregarded in computing entire net income, and there shall be added to or subtracted from the portion of entire net income allocated within the city the gain or loss upon such sale or other disposition. In computing such gain or loss the basis of the property sold or disposed of shall be adjusted to reflect the deduction allowed with respect to such property pursuant to subparagraph one or two of this paragraph. Provided, however, that no loss shall be recognized for the purposes of this subparagraph with respect to a sale or other disposition of property to a person whose acquisition thereof is not a purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code. 4. The portion of the business capital of a taxpayer to be allocated within the city shall be determined by multiplying the amount thereof by the business allocation percentage determined as hereinabove provided. Provided, however, such business allocation percentage, for purposes of allocating business capital, shall (a) for taxable years beginning before nineteen hundred ninety-four, be determined without regard to clause (C) of subparagraph six of paragraph (a) of subdivision three of this section and (b) for taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-three, be determined with regard to such clause (C) but only in the case of a taxpayer subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of subdivision six of section 11-602 of this subchapter. 5. The portion of the investment capital of a taxpayer to be allocated within the city shall be determined by multiplying the amount thereof by the investment allocation percentage determined as hereinabove provided. 7. The portion of the subsidiary capital of a taxpayer to be allocated within the city shall be determined by (a) multiplying the amount of its subsidiary capital invested in each subsidiary during the period covered by its report (or, in the case of any such capital so invested during only a portion of such period, such portion of such capital) by the issuer's allocation percentage, as defined in subparagraph one of paragraph (b) of subdivision three of this section, of each such subsidiary and (b) adding together the sums so obtained. 8. If it shall appear to the commissioner of finance that any business or investment allocation percentage determined as hereinabove provided does not properly reflect the activity, business, income or capital of a taxpayer within the city, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized in his or her discretion, in the case of a business allocation percentage, to adjust it by (a) excluding one or more of the factors therein, (b) including one or more other factors, such as expenses, purchases, contract values (minus subcontract values), (c) excluding one or more assets in computing such allocation percentage, provided the income therefrom is also excluded in determining entire net income, or (d) any other similar or different method calculated to effect a fair and proper allocation of the income and capital reasonably attributable to the city, and in the case of an investment allocation percentage to adjust it by excluding one or more assets in computing such percentage provided the income therefrom is also excluded in determining entire net income. The commissioner of finance from time to time shall publish all rulings of general public interest with respect to any application of the provisions of this subdivision. 9. If it shall appear to the commissioner of finance that any business allocation percentage determined as hereinabove provided does not properly reflect the activity, business, income or capital of a taxpayer within the city, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized in his or her discretion to adjust it by (a) excluding one or more of the factors therein, (b) including one or more other factors, such as expenses, purchases, contract values (minus subcontract values), (c) excluding one or more assets in computing such allocation percentage, provided the income therefrom, is also excluded in determining entire net income, or (d) any other similar or different method calculated to effect a fair and proper allocation of the income and capital reasonably attributable to the city, and in the case of an investment allocation percentage, to adjust it by excluding one or more assets in computing such percentage provided the income therefrom is also excluded in determining entire net income. The commissioner of finance from time to time shall publish all rulings of general public interest with respect to any application of the provisions of this subdivision. 11. (a) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit, to be refunded in the manner hereinafter provided in this subdivision, against the tax imposed by this chapter. The amount of such credit shall be fifty percent of the tax incurred in market making transactions under the provisions of article twelve of the tax law on such transactions subject to such tax occurring on and after August first, nineteen hundred seventy-six and paid by such taxpayer (except when such tax shall have been paid pursuant to section two hundred seventy-nine-a of such tax law). (b) For purposes of this subdivision: (1) the term \"taxpayer\" shall mean any corporation subject to tax under this chapter registered with the United States securities and exchange commission in accordance with subsection (b) of section fifteen of the securities exchange act of nineteen hundred thirty-four, as amended, and acting as a dealer in a transaction described in subparagraph two of this paragraph, and (2) the term \"market making transaction\" shall mean any transaction involving a sale (including a short sale) by a dealer of shares or certificates subject to the tax imposed by article twelve of the tax law, provided such shares or certificates are sold: (i) as stock in trade or inventory or as property held for sale in the ordinary course of such dealer's trade or business (including transfers which are part of an underwriting), (ii) in (a) a bona fide arbitrage transaction; (b) a bona fide hedge transaction involving a long or short position in any equity security and a long or short position in a security entitling the holder to acquire or sell such equity security; or (c) a risk arbitrage transaction in connection with a merger, acquisition, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, or similar transaction, or (iii) to offset a transaction made in error. Provided, however, that, except as to subclause (c) of clause (ii) of this paragraph, the term \"market making transaction\" shall not include any sale of shares or certificates identified in such dealer's records as a security held for investment within the meaning of section twelve hundred thirty-six of the internal revenue code. (c) The credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year shall be deemed to be an overpayment of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in subdivision three of section 11-606 and subdivision eleven of section 11-608; provided, however, that the provisions of this title notwithstanding, the amount to be refunded pursuant to this subdivision shall not be paid prior to the first day of the eighth month following the close of the taxable year, and the provisions of subdivision three of section 11-679 of this chapter notwithstanding interest shall be allowed and paid on the overpayment of the credit under this subdivision from the first day of the eleventh month following the close of the taxable year, or three months after a claim for the credit or refund provided for in this subdivision has been filed, whichever is later. (d) Provided, however, that the credit provided under this subdivision shall be allowed only to the extent that the amount of credit allowable with respect to market making transactions under the provisions of this subdivision (determined without regard to the provisions of this paragraph) exceeds fifty percent of all rebates (provided for under the provisions of section two hundred eighty-a of article twelve of the tax law) allowed for such taxes incurred in the same market making transactions with respect to which the credit is determined.

(b)(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (a) of this subdivision, in the case of a corporation that, before the application of this subdivision or any other credit allowed by this section, is liable for the tax on entire net income under clause one of subparagraph (a) of paragraph E of subdivision one of this section, the credit or the sum of the credits that may be taken by such corporation for a taxable year under this subdivision with respect to an unincorporated business or unincorporated businesses in which it is a partner shall not exceed the tax so computed, without allowance of any credits allowed by this section, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is four and the denominator of which is eight and eighty-five one hundredths.

For purposes of this paragraph each dollar of credit shall be applied so as to reduce such tax for taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand seven by sixty-six and thirty-eight one hundredths cents; for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand seven and before January first, two thousand eight by fifty-eight and eight one-hundredths cents; for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand eight and before January first, two thousand nine by forty-nine and seventy-eight one-hundredths cents; for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand nine and before January first, two thousand ten by forty-one and forty-eight one-hundredths cents; and for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand ten by thirty-three and nineteen one-hundredths cents.

In applying the provisions of the preceding sentence, the credit determined for the taxable year under paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall be taken before taking any credit carryforward pursuant to this paragraph and the credit carryforward attributable to the earliest taxable year shall be taken before taking a credit carryforward attributable to a subsequent taxable year.

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subdivision, if the amount of the credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year exceeds the tax imposed for such year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to the five immediately succeeding taxable years and, to the extent not previously deductible, may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such years. (d) The credits allowed under this subdivision, against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year of the relocation and for the four taxable years immediately succeeding the taxable year of such relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter.

However, if the qualified production costs (excluding post production costs) which are attributable to the use of tangible property or the performance of services at a qualified film production facility in the production of such qualified film are less than three million dollars, then the portion of the qualified production costs attributable to the use of tangible property or the performance of services in the production of such qualified film outside of a qualified film production facility shall be allowed only if the shooting days spent in the city of New York outside of a film production facility in the production of such qualified film equal or exceed seventy-five percent of the total shooting days spent within and without the city of New York outside of a film production facility in the production of such qualified film.

Provided, however, if the amount of credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year reduces the tax to such amount, any amount of credit not deductible in such taxable year shall be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section 11-677 of this chapter; provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-679 of this chapter, no interest shall be paid thereon.
